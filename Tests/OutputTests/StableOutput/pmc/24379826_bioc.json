          "text": "Increased serum uric acid (SUA) is a risk factor for gout and renal and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The purpose of this study was to identify genetic factors that affect the variation in SUA in 632 Mexican Americans participants of the San Antonio Family Heart Study (SAFHS). A genome-wide association (GWA) analysis was performed using the Illumina Human Hap 550K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray. We used a linear regression-based association test under an additive model of allelic effect, while accounting for non-independence among family members via a kinship variance component. All analyses were performed in the software package SOLAR. SNPs rs6832439, rs13131257, and rs737267 in solute carrier protein 2 family, member 9 (SLC2A9) were associated with SUA at genome-wide significance (p < 1.3 × 10−7). The minor alleles of these SNPs had frequencies of 36.2, 36.2, and 38.2%, respectively, and were associated with decreasing SUA levels. All of these SNPs were located in introns 3–7 of SLC2A9, the location of the previously reported associations in European populations. When analyzed for association with cardiovascular-renal disease risk factors, conditional on SLC2A9 SNPs strongly associated with SUA, significant associations were found for SLC2A9 SNPs with BMI, body weight, and waist circumference (p < 1.4 × 10−3) and suggestive associations with albumin-creatinine ratio and total antioxidant status (TAS). The SLC2A9 gene encodes an urate transporter that has considerable influence on variation in SUA. In addition to the primary association locus, suggestive evidence (p < 1.9 × 10−6) for joint linkage/association (JLA) was found at a previously-reported urate quantitative trait locus (Logarithm of odds score = 3.6) on 3p26.3. In summary, our GWAS extends and confirms the association of SLC2A9 with SUA for the first time in a Mexican American cohort and also shows for the first time its association with cardiovascular-renal disease risk factors.",

However, none of them were in the same location as found previously in this Mexican American Cohort (Voruganti et al., 2009a). Similarly, genome-wide association (GWA) and candidate gene studies have found several genes to be associated with SUA, mainly solute carrier protein 2 family, member 9 (SLC2A9) (Li et al., 2007; Brandstätter et al., 2008; Caulfield et al., 2008; Dehghan et al., 2008; Döring et al., 2008; McArdle et al., 2008; Stark et al., 2008; Vitart et al., 2008; Wallace et al., 2008; Kolz et al., 2009; Charles et al., 2011; Karns et al., 2012), ATP-binding cassette, subfamily G, member 2 (ABCG2) (Kolz et al., 2009; Woodward et al., 2009; Nakayama et al., 2011; Karns et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2013); solute carrier protein 22 family, members 11 and 12 (SLC22A11, SLC22A12) (Kolz et al., 2009; Tin et al., 2011), solute carrier protein 16 family, member 9 (SLC16A9), PDZ domain containing 1(PDZK1) (Kolz et al., 2009). A large GWAS in another European cohort, Köttgen et al. (2013), confirmed or replicated 28 previously reported associations for SUA. However, most of these studies were conducted in Caucasian, African American, or Asian populations. To date no GWAS of SUA levels have been conducted in Mexican Americans—a population affected with disproportionate burden of CVD and type 2 diabetes (Flegal et al., 1991; Go, 2013; http://www.diabetes.org/diabetes-basics/diabetes-statistics/).",

          "text": "SUA is a strong marker of risk for renal disease and is considered clinically relevant and of high significance. Its role as a major risk factor in the development of kidney stones or nephrolithiasis and gout is well-recognized. The relationship between uric acid and kidney function seems to be two-sided. On one hand, decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (kidney function parameter) may lead to elevation of uric acid, on the other hand, increase in uric acid seems to alter glomerular function through renal vasoconstriction and increased rennin expression (Sánchez-Lozada et al., 2002). Hyperuricemia is also known to induce endothelial dysfunction and inflammation indicating a role in atherosclerosis as well as chronic kidney disease (Ejaz et al., 2012). Rodent Sánchez-Lozada et al., 2002; Ejaz et al., 2012 and human studies (Nakagawa et al., 2005; Liebman et al., 2007) have shown the role of hyperuricemia in hypertension, atherosclerosis, CVD, initiation and progression of renal disease, and metabolic syndrome. In fact, drugs that decrease SUA levels, mainly allopurinol, have been shown to improve survival in chronic heart failure patients (Gotsman et al., 2012), improve endothelial function in patients with chronic kidney disease (Yelken et al., 2012), and reduce oxidative stress and improve endothelial function in patients with coronary artery disease (Rajendra et al., 2011). Elaborating on the protective effects of reduced SUA levels on end-stage renal disease (ESRD), Doria and Krolewski (2011) point out that lowering of SUA may be a potential approach to treat ESRD in patients with diabetes.",

Study subjects have been recalled up to three times to acquire longitudinal data; the analysis reported here is based on the second recall, 2002–2006. Individuals were recruited from large Mexican American families, residing in San Antonio, TX without regard to disease status. Participants in this study were recruited from 40 extended families, with probands between 40 and 60 years of age (MacCluer et al., 1999; Mitchell et al., 1999). Eligibility criteria required the proband to have at least six first-degree relatives (excluding their parents) 16 years or older and who resided in San Antonio, TX. At each recruitment phase, subjects were brought to a research clinic at the University of Texas Health Science Center—San Antonio (UTHSCSA) for interview and examination by trained recruiters and nurses. Anthropometrics including height, weight, and waist circumference; blood pressure; and self-reported information regarding medical history and socio-demographic status were obtained in all phases of SAFHS data collection. Blood samples were collected from all participants after an overnight fast and plasma and serum were prepared and stored at −80°C until analyzed. Blood samples were also drawn at 2 h after a standard oral glucose tolerance test; diabetes was diagnosed if the 2 h glucose level was 11.1 mmol/l or higher, or if the subject had been prescribed antidiabetic medication. The final analysis sample with complete phenotype and genotype data included 632 SAFHS participants. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants to participate in this study. All research and consenting protocols were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the UTHSCSA.",

This is the first GWAS for SUA in Mexican Americans and replicates results from several studies conducted in European populations from the UK, Germany, Croatia and Sardinia. Recent GWAS have shown consistently that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the SLC2A9 gene are associated with SUA levels (Li et al., 2007; Döring et al., 2008; McArdle et al., 2008; Stark et al., 2008; Vitart et al., 2008; Zemunik et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2010). A study conducted in a Croatian sample found that SLC2A9 variants were associated with SUA with SNPs explaining 1.7–5.3% of the variance in SUA levels. In the same study, this association was replicated in a sample from the island of Orkney (Vitart et al., 2008). Two of the three SNPs associated with SUA in this study were the same as shown in our study (rs6449213 and rs737267). In addition, the effect sizes (proportion of residual phenotypic variance explained by the SNP) of our significant association are in the same range (4–5% of total phenotypic variance). Similarly, in a cohort from Germany, SUA levels were associated with SLC2A9 variants (19). Of the several SNPs that were associated only rs6449213 was common between our two studies. They also showed sex-specific effects of variants in SLC2A9 on SUA levels. This finding was replicated by Brandstätter et al. (2008). Other studies that showed association of polymorphisms in SLC2A9 with SUA were conducted in individuals from Sardinia (Li et al., 2007), Germany (Stark et al., 2008), and the United Kingdom (Wallace et al., 2008; Kolz et al., 2009) as well as in Asian (Matsuo et al., 2008; Cummings et al., 2010; Tabara et al., 2010; Tu et al., 2010; Guan et al., 2011) and African American populations (Dehghan et al., 2008; Rule et al., 2011). To investigate the functional aspects of the SLC2A9 gene, Caulfield et al. (2008) showed that SLC2A9 was a high-capacity urate transporter and can exchange glucose for urate in the process of secretion of urate into the urine. They also confirmed the previously reported association of SLC2A9 with SUA in six different cohorts of European ancestry. Several other loci have also been reported to be associated with serum uric acid levels in GWAS as well as candidate gene association studies (Table ​(Table44).",

Originally thought to be only a facilitated hexose transporter, it was found to be primarily involved in uric acid transport. Its two forms SLC2A9a and SLC2A9b are expressed in the basolateral and apical membranes of the kidney while SLC2A9a is also expressed in liver. Their amino acid sequences are identical, except that SLC2A9b has a shorter and modified N-terminus (Preitner et al., 2009). Both forms are involved in renal urate transport (Le et al., 2008; Cheeseman, 2009). Caulfield et al. (2008) proposed that extracellular glucose and intracellular urate are exchanged by the SLC2A9 transporter. In the kidney SLC2A9 maintains uric acid reabsorption independent of other uric acid transporters (Preitner et al., 2009). On one hand SLC2A9 mutations are associated with hypouricemia and hyperuricosuria, while on the other, mutations in SLC2A9 that alter the protein impair urate secretion into the urine resulting in hyperuricemia (Le et al., 2008; Cheeseman, 2009).",

In addition, our joint-linkage association approach has the potential to maximize the information in a sample of related individuals, thus amplifying a signal taking into account fixed effects of marker genotypes (association) and the random effects of shared sequence identity (linkage). With this approach we found suggestive evidence of association on chromosome 3p25-p26 as we showed in our prior linkage analysis (Voruganti et al., 2009a). Associated SNPs were found within the contactin 4 (CNTN4) gene, which is located in the one-LOD support interval in our previous linkage scan for SUA levels. The CNTN4 gene codes for a member of the contactin subgroup of cell adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily. This family has an important role in the formation and functioning of the neuronal networks; specifically, CNTN4 is known to play a key role in development of the central nervous system. The possible functional relationship of this gene to SUA levels is unknown.",

Common marker variants like those in SLC2A9 (minor allele frequency 36–38% in our cohort) should, in theory, be in LD with one or more common functional variants whose effect on the trait of interest should be similar in different lineages. On the other hand, low-frequency functional variants (and low-frequency marker alleles in LD with them) are expected to appear in only a subset of lineages; these pedigree-specific effects are more likely to be identified by linkage than by association. In this context, it is interesting that our replication of association at SLC2A9 is not matched by a linkage signal, while the SNPs identified by joint linkage and association within a strong linkage peak on chromosome 3 have low minor allele frequencies (3–9%)—both findings being consistent with theoretical expectation. These results may also explain why our chromosome 3 QTL has apparently not been reported by other studies, which are primarily population-based; however, the current upsurge in analysis of next-generation sequencing data and improved methods for rare variant detection may provide opportunities to test our findings in the near future.",

          "text": "Since SUA is associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes and CVD risk and is advocated by many to be included as a component of the metabolic syndrome, we conducted a measured genotype analysis for SLC2A9 SNPs and these risk factors. We found evidence of significant associations of SLC2A9 SNPs with body weight, BMI and waist circumference and suggestive associations with TAS. In the same study we also reported significant genetic correlations between SUA and waist circumference in the same study (Voruganti et al., 2009a). Variants in the uric acid transporter gene (SLC2A9) that have been associated with lower SUA were also associated with decreased blood pressure (Parsa et al., 2012). Similarly, another SLC2A9 variant (rs1014290), associated with lower SUA were also associated with decreased risk for diabetes mellitus (Liu et al., 2011) in Han Chinese. In a study by Brandstätter et al. (2008), the association between SLC2A9 SNPs and SUA was significantly modified by BMI. They showed stronger effect size in individuals with higher BMI. However, the precise mechanism that may explain this association is not clear. In contrast, Vitart et al. (2008) found no association between SLC2A9 SNPs and metabolic syndrome components. Caulfield et al. (2008) explored the association of SLC2A9 SNPs and blood pressure traits and found no significant association. We also observed that the SNPs associated with body weight, BMI, or waist circumference were different than those associated with SUA levels. However, the two SNPs associated with TAS were also associated with SUA levels. SUA is known to act as a free radical scavenger (Pasalic et al., 2012) and combat oxidative stress (Johnson et al., 2011). Therefore, the possible link between them may be the role of SUA as an “antioxidant.”",

          "text": "In addition, we found suggestive association between SLC2A9 SNPs and the renal disease development marker UACR. Knock out rodent studies have shown that SLC2A9 knockout mice develop urate nephropathy characterized by intra-tubular urate lithiasis, interstitial inflammation and fibrosis and tubular atrophy (Preitner et al., 2009). SUA levels in humans are primarily determined by renal uric acid clearance, with two-thirds of uric acid turnover being accounted for by its urinary excretion. Hyperuricemia is predictably associated with a decrease in GFR (Culleton, 2001; Johnson et al., 2003; Feig, 2009) and 90% of clinically-recognized hyperuricemia results from impaired renal excretion of uric acid (Le et al., 2008). Abnormal renal urate handling can promote both uric acid and calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis by distinct mechanisms; low urine pH favors uric acid crystallization while mixed uric acid- or sodium urate-calcium oxalate stones develop by epitaxy, “salting out” of calcium oxalate or adsorption of crystal growth inhibitors (Liebman et al., 2007). Hyperuricemia has also been implicated in the development of hypertension, a major risk factor for the development and progression of chronic kidney disease (Feig, 2009). Micropuncture studies have shown that elevated uric acid levels cause cortical vasoconstriction and increase glomerular capillary pressure leading to progressive glomerular injury (Sánchez-Lozada et al., 2002). Given the role of SLC2A9 in renal urate transport, the association between SLC2A9 SNPs and UACR assumes pathogenic significance.",
