To identify genetic influences on facial asymmetry, we developed a method for automated scoring that summarizes local morphology features and their spatial distribution. A genome-wide association study using asymmetry scores from two local symmetry features was conducted and significant genetic associations were identified for one asymmetry feature, including genes thought to play a role in craniofacial disorders and development: NFATC1, SOX5, NBAS, and TCF7L1. These results provide evidence that normal variation in facial asymmetry may be impacted by common genetic variants and further motivate the development of automated summaries of complex phenotypes.",

Biomedical imaging creates very high dimensional datasets that can be analyzed and used to extract phenotype descriptions. Traditional phenotyping from images consists of 2D and 3D measurements of landmarks manually placed on the image. Landmark data is typically sparse and is likely insufficient to capture the complexity necessary for an association with genetic data. A recent study, testing the relationship of facial asymmetry, estimated from nine mid-facial landmarks, with genetic variation at 102 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci, recently associated with facial shape variation, was unable to identify any SNP relating to asymmetry (Windhager et al., 2014). Methods for automatically phenotyping images and incorporating complex shape information, will be key in understanding the genetic basis of morphology. New approaches such as the BRIM method, developed by Claes et al., have shown the promise of summarizing morphological differences in novel ways to identify genes affecting normal morphology (Claes et al., 2014). The aim of this study is to use automated phenotyping to produce a score of facial asymmetry that incorporates local morphological measurements and their spatial distribution to investigate the genetic basis of facial asymmetry.",

Surface registration-based methods show particular promise due to their independence from the plane of symmetry and ability to provide dense shape information across the surface of the face. Recent applications of surface-registration based methods have been validated by comparison to traditional landmark methods and used quantified asymmetry in individuals using the average transform magnitude or root mean squared error from predefined regions (Claes et al., 2011; Kornreich et al., 2016; Öwall et al., 2016; Verhoeven et al., 2016) and principle modes of variation (Lanche et al., 2007).",

The dataset consisted of 3D photographic facial surface scans and genetic data from 3186 3D facial meshes from healthy subjects of European Caucasian ancestry, between the ages of 3 and 40 years old. Error screening and quality control measures were followed to reduce variability, due to factors such as facial expression and poor image quality. Subjects were screened for many confounding environmental factors, including: (1) a personal history of facial trauma; (2) a personal history of facial reconstructive or plastic surgery; (3) a personal history of orthognathic/jaw surgery or jaw advancement; (4) a personal history of any facial prosthetics or implants; (5) a personal history of any palsy, stroke, or neurologic condition affecting the face; (6) a personal or family history of any facial anomaly or birth defect; and/or (7) a personal or family history of any syndrome or congenital condition known to affect the head and/or face (Weinberg et al., 2016). To demonstrate that the age range in this dataset did not disrupt the results, we also ran a GWAS excluding pre-pubertal individuals (under 14).

These commercial stereo-photography systems incorporate multiple camera viewpoints to provide a 3D mesh of the human face, at no risk to the subject, with the high level of anatomical integrity required for medical research. Several recent studies have assessed the amount of noise or variability that may be present in 3D meshes acquired using the 3dMD system, compared to alternative methods such as direct anthropometry and digital photogrammetry (Dindaroğlu et al., 2016), or high-accuracy industrial “line-laser” scanning (Zhao et al., 2017). The findings from these studies suggest that the number of errors likely to be present in a 3dMD dataset is similar to, or an improvement over more traditional methods. The facial surface scans were stored as 3D meshes that were not aligned and may contain extraneous objects such as hair and clothing. Prior to analysis, images were preprocessed to remove noise, cropped to extract the facial region and aligned using custom software developed by our research group (Wu et al., 2014).",

While these features have been shown to be effective, we propose a method to produce a richer phenotype description by scoring an individual's relationship to a model of normal asymmetry using both global and local differences. In this work, the global assessment of facial asymmetry is restricted to the region below the eyes (defined by the right and left endocathion landmarks). This restriction limits noise caused by eyelashes, eyebrows, and the hairline and is consistent with landmark-based analysis for this data set, as landmarks were not collected in the forehead region (Weinberg et al., 2016).",

Of these SNPs with highly significant associations, three are located on genes with known links to craniofacial abnormality and asymmetry (NFATC1, SOX5, and NBAS) and one (SNX6) is on a gene with a potential link. NFATC1 encodes a transcription factor that plays a role in mandibular development and the Wnt signaling pathway, which is instrumental to facial morphogenesis (Winslow et al., 2006; Brugmann et al., 2007; Doraczynska-Kowalik et al., 2017). Mutations in NFATC1 are linked to Cherubism, a disorder characterized by abnormal bone tissue in the lower part of the face and a characteristic facial phenotype (Kadlub et al., 2016). A recent GWA study of morphological measurements has also suggested a possible link between this gene and measurements of the mouth (Lee et al., 2017). SOX5 encodes a transcription factor involved in the regulation of embryonic development that is thought to play a role in chondrogenesis. SOX5 is linked to Lamb-Shaffer Syndrome, which can cause an abnormal craniofacial phenotype including a facial asymmetry, depressed and/or broad nasal bridge, and bulbous nasal tip (Lamb et al., 2012). Mutations in NBAS are associated with Pelger-Huet Anomaly, which has a phenotype including facial asymmetry, long face, and straight nose (Segarra et al., 2015). It is also linked to Feingold Syndrome 1, which can result in craniofacial dismorphology including asymmetry, triangular shaped face, and flat nasal tip (Chen et al., 2012). SNX6, a member sorting nexin family, has not been definitively linked to craniofacial disorders, however multiple studies have suggested it as a candidate gene for holoprosencephaly, the most common developmental field defect in patterning of the human prosencephalon and associated craniofacial structures (Kamnasaran et al., 2005; Segawa et al., 2007). Also of interest is TCF7L1, which encodes for a transcription factor that mediates the Wnt signaling pathway and has been found to have high expression in the developing murine palate (Potter and Potter, 2015).",

Two SNPs of interest are located on the gene FANCC, which encodes a DNA repair protein with a role in the maintenance of normal chromosome stability. FANCC is implicated in Gorlin syndrome that has a phenotype including broad nasal root, cleft lip, and cleft palate (Reichert et al., 2015). FANCC is also linked to Fanconi anemia that has a phenotype including craniosynostosis, microencephaly and small eyes (de Winter et al., 2000). FTO is a protein coding gene associated with growth retardation, developmental delay, and facial dysmorphism (Boissel et al., 2009; Daoud et al., 2015). The associated phenotype includes skull asymmetry, coarse facial features, abnormal positioning of the maxilla or mandible, prominent alveolar ridge, and cleft palate.

It is likely to be influenced by complex and interelated factors, which can be difficult to control for in human studies, presenting significant challenges for analysis. Asymmetry, especially fluctuating asymmetry, has been hypothesized to be closely linked to developmental instability and many studies have interpreted it as a marker of environmental stress during development (Klingenberg and McIntyre, 1998; DeLeon, 2007; Ozener, 2010). However, several recent studies have called these findings into question and have suggested a stronger role of heredity (Quinto-Sánchez et al., 2015, 2017). Further studies using genotype and phenotype data are needed to better understand how the developmental processes leading to asymmetry are impacted by environmental factors. While subjects in our study were screened for a number of possible environmental influences on facial asymmetry, as detailed in section 2.1, many other potential confounding factors remain, such as twinning status and smoking behavior that are unknown or could not feasibly be controlled for in this study. Despite these limitations, we have applied a data-driven approach to evaluate methods for quantifying aspects of asymmetry that may be related to biological processes resulting in facial asymmetry.",

While we are cautious about interpreting the results from a angle of deformation asymmetry score, due to the weak associations, several of the genes of interest identified are associated with embryonic morphology and development and craniofacial abnormality.
