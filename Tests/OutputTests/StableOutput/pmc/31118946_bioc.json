          "text": "Obesity is a worldwide epidemic associated with increased morbidity of chronic diseases, including diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome, and cancer. In 2015, 603.7 million adults and 107.7 million children were obese; furthermore, in many countries the incidence of obesity continues to rise, doubling since 1980 (Afshin et al., 2017). This in turn imposes an enormous burden on the public health system. Many studies have shown that 40–70% of inter-individual variability in obesity can be attributed to genetic factors (Zaitlen et al., 2013; Locke et al., 2015). Currently, large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and meta-analyses have successfully identified in excess of 75 loci associated with obesity (Fall and Ingelsson, 2014). Nevertheless, these genetic variability can explain only a minor fraction of obesity cases (Li et al., 2010; Speliotes et al., 2010). This is partly due to the existence of other mechanisms such as epigenetics, gene-environment, and gene-gene interactions, that influence the heritability of obesity (Gibson, 2010; Wang X. et al., 2010). Almost one-third of the genetic variance in the etiology of obesity were due to non-additive factors, according to the family, twin and adoption studies (Stunkard et al., 1986; Price, 1987; Sorensen et al., 1989; Stunkard et al., 1990).",

In research to date on the influence of interactions, most studies invariably selected loci based on biological knowledge and known associated loci, studies of genome-wide gene x gene interactions are rare. Speliotes et al. (2010) tested SNP-SNP interaction effects among 32 BMI-associated SNPs in their GWAS result, however, no significant results were obtained after multiple test corrections. Young et al. (2016) found the interaction rs11847697(PRKD1)-rs9939609 (FTO) associated with BMI via pairwise SNP × SNP interactions analysis based on 34 established BMI-related SNPs in European American adolescents.

This method did not need the selection of candidate sites, but computational time was a very large barrier. With the advancement of computing technology, the major barrier has been overcome, and SNP-SNP interaction studies gradually focused on the whole genome level. Wei et al. (2012) performed GWIAs for BMI using multiple human populations, and found eight interactions that had a significant P-value in one or more cohorts. Their studies further demonstrated the GWIA is an effective approach to explain the genetic factor of BMI. SNP-SNP interactions have always been explained by mapping to gene-gene interactions, and genome-wide pathway-based association analysis will further support the interpretation of gene-gene interactions. “Pathway” means a gene set collected from the same biological or functional pathway. Pathway-based association analysis will measure the correlations between phenotypes and gene sets based on the whole genome. This approach can provide additional biological insights and allow one to explore new candidate genes (Wang K. et al., 2010).",

In order to rule out the possibility of an accidental finding, we mapped these SNPs to genes, then excluded the SNP-SNP interactions by the following criteria: ① neither SNPs exist in genes; ② either of the two SNPs exist independently in a gene. Through the above exclusion criteria, the rs7800006(EXOC4)-rs10797020(1q23.1) interaction was the most significant (P = 2.63 × 10-11), where there were 39 interactions with P < 10-8 between EXOC4 and 1q23.1. Five SNPs exist in the EXOC4 gene region and 9 SNPs exist in the 1q23.1 region, but their interaction P-value did not pass Bonferroni multiple tests. However, the Bonferroni correction test is highly conservative and would overcorrect for the non-independent SNPs, which fall within blocks of strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) (Duggal et al., 2008). Morris and Kaplan (2002) have reported that haplotype-based association analyses are more powerful than single allele-based methods when multiple disease-susceptibility mutations occur within the same gene. Epstein and Satten (2003) also have pointed out that haplotypes are useful during disease development due to the interaction of multiple cis-acting susceptibility variants located at the gene.",

Despite this, some obesity-related interactions still have been found, including PRKD1-FTO and WNT4-WNT5A (Wei et al., 2012; Young et al., 2016; Dong et al., 2017). Pathway-based analysis is an alternative approach to detect gene interactions. Liu et al. (2010) had found that the vasoactive intestinal peptide pathway was significantly correlated with BMI and fat mass, suggesting that this pathway plays an important role in the development of obesity.
