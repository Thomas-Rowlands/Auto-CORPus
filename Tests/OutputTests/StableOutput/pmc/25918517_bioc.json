          "text": "In genetic analyses performed in this paper we used a modified statistical procedure of testing genetic associations with longevity related traits. The populations whose data are used in GWAS often have genetic structures called “population stratification” (PS). Such structures are caused by non-random mating between groups of individuals followed by different patterns of genetic drift of allele frequencies in each group. Without proper controlling for PS in the statistical procedures used in GWAS of complex traits the analyses may result in erroneous (false-positive) associations. To avoid such errors the genetic association studies of complex traits include control for potential PS. The method of principal components analyses (PCA) suggested in Price et al. (2006) identifies several top principal components (PCs) in genetic data and uses them as observed covariates in the statistical estimation procedure in GWAS. Although this approach may be efficient in GWAS of many complex traits it may create problems in genetic association studies of human longevity. This is because the process of mortality selection that takes place in genetically heterogeneous cohorts may generate additional genetic structures in the study populations. This structure which involves genetic variants affecting life span may be captured by the selected principal components. As a result, controlling for PS in GWAS of human aging and longevity may reduce the estimates of associations of genetic variants with longevity traits, i.e., it may substantially attenuate the signals from the genetic variants one wants to detect. In this paper we applied the new procedure for controlling for population stratification (see Section S1 in Supplementary Materials) in GWAS of human life span using data on females from the original cohort of the Framingham Heart Study (FHS). This procedure as well as the results of analyses using traditional and modified methods of controlling for potential PS in GWAS of human longevity are described in Yashin et al. (2014). We investigated the associations of the detected genetic variants with life span in males from the original and in males and females from the offspring FHS cohorts as well as with health related traits and age trajectories of biomarkers from the original cohort. We also investigated functional properties of genes related to detected variants.",

The quality control (QC) procedure included 95% call rate for the sample and 95% call rate for SNPs, and HWE p-value > 1E-7. After applying the QC procedure, the data on 1111 individuals with information about lifespan and 429,783 SNPs were available for the analysis. Life spans for 204 study subjects (52 males and 152 females) were censored. We used EMMAX software to perform GWAS of female lifespan data from the original FHS cohort with modified correction for population stratification. In the confirmation phase we used genetic and the life span data on males from the same FHS cohort and the life span data on males and females combined from the offspring FHS cohort. Using available data on cancer (all sites but skin) and CVD as well as longitudinal data on physiological indices we estimated age trajectories of probabilities of staying free of the corresponding diseases for carriers and non-carriers of selected genetic variants as well as associations of these variants with age trajectories of physiological indices.

Since associations of the variants with lifespan in our GWAS have the same direction of the effect in both genders, the Kaplan–Meier estimates of conditional survival functions for the genotyped members of the original FHS cohort were evaluated for males and females combined. In such evaluation we took into account that the life span data on the members of the original FHS cohort are right censored and left truncated. Note that for genetic analyses one should use age at blood collection (not the age at baseline) as the left truncation variable. We calculated these variables using data from the DNA Draw Date file available for FHS data from the dbGaP. Then we calculated ages at death/censoring of those 1111 individuals using age at the first exam and the number of days since the first exam until the death event or censoring which are provided in the Framingham data. Using these data and the R package “survival” we calculated Kaplan–Meier estimates of conditional survival functions for carriers and non-carriers of selected genetic variants who survived until specific ages (e.g., 70 or 80 years).",

For rs7894051, the negative effect of the minor allele on survival became pronounced only after age 80 years. The probabilities of survival for carriers and non-carriers of these variants at the age interval between 70 and 80 years are about the same. For rs4904670, the negative effect on survival starts from the age 80. This SNP manifests a survival trade-off, with minor allele having positive effect on survival at ages before 80 and negative effect afterwards. This illustrates the changing age-specific influence of genes on vulnerability to death. The role of age as a modulator of genetic effects on lifespan was suggested and discussed in our prior works (De Benedictis et al., 1998; Yashin et al., 1999, 2000, 2001; Ukraintseva, 2005). Later, it was also noted in Atzmon et al. (2006). Age-dependence of genetic effects on health and related traits was also extensively discussed and analyzed in the past by different research groups (e.g., Jarvik et al., 1997) including our own (e.g., Kulminski et al., 2013). Note that the harmful influence of the minor alleles on survival after the age 80 was manifested for all eight genetic variants listed in Table S2. The Cox regression analyses applied to the life span data from the original FHS cohort showed that the difference in survival curves among minor allele carriers and non-carriers for each of the eight SNPs, males and females combined, was highly statistically significant (Table S3 Effects of gene-environment interaction on survival: the case of smoking).",

The pattern observed in Figure ​Figure3A3A may take place when the effect of this allele on cancer risk is opposite in males and females. To test this possibility, we evaluated the age patterns of probabilities of staying free of cancer for males and females separately. The graphs shown in Figures 3C,D provide evidence that such situation does take place: the effects of minor alleles on cancer risk after age 80 were opposite in males and females for both rs7894051 and rs4904670. That is, the presence of the minor allele in person's genome increased the risk of cancer in females and reduced it in males for both the SNPs (Figures 3C–F). However, for rs4904670 the reduction of cancer risk in males did not fully compensate for the increase in such risk in females, so that the total effect of the minor allele of this SNP on cancer risk for males and females combined was detrimental. The effects of rs7894051 and rs4904670 on mortality rates from CVD and cancer are shown in Tables S4, S5 in Supplementary Materials. The vulnerability variants of these two SNPs increased the risk of CHD onset after age 80 (Figures S2, S3 and Table S6). Since carrying the vulnerability allele reduced the cancer risk in males at the same ages, these results suggest potentially important role of antagonistic pleiotropic effects of genes in determining their impact on longevity.",

We conducted review of current knowledge about biological and health effects of these SNPs and related genes using up-to-date publications and reliable online sources such as NCBI's PubMed, Entrez Gene, dbSNP, OMIM, Ensembl, GeneCards, GO, and MetaCore from Thomson Reuters. Genes related to SNPs identified in this study (or to SNPs that are in LD with them) are largely involved in mitochondrial oxidation, apoptosis, and protein degradation in cell. These processes are important part of cell/tissue responses to stress or damage. For example, the NRDE2 (C14orf102) gene is linked to PSMC1, a subunit of 26S proteasome involved in protein degradation, essential for cell damage response. PSMC1 may potentially interact with PSMD13, which is another subunit of the same 26S proteasome involved in protein degradation. ECHS1 is involved in mitochondrial oxidation and apoptosis, also essential for cell/tissue response to damage (Table ​(Table11).",

The frequent involvement of aging/longevity associated genes in neurological disorders suggests an intriguing possibility that genes predisposing to such disorders may accelerate brain physiological aging, and through this negatively impact longevity (in addition to direct pathological effects). A number of recent studies indicate that this might be the case, especially for schizophrenia (Kochunov et al., 2013; Koutsouleris et al., 2014; Shivakumar et al., 2014; Wright et al., 2014; Silver and Bilker, 2015). Potential mechanisms by which the same genetic factor may influence aging and brain pathology could involve, for example, declines in regenerative response to damage, neural repair, axons outgrowth, and synaptic transmission, typical of both brain aging and brain disorders (Balu and Coyle, 2011; Edwards et al., 2011; Ferguson and Son, 2011; Haroutunian et al., 2014).",

If person who carries such a genetic risk factor for cancer nevertheless survives the period of the highest cancer risk (before age 85), s/he may get an advantage from attenuated physical senescence at older ages, so that such genetic variant may contribute to both longevity and cancer (in case of our study, in males only).

Although the results of numerous GWAS of human aging and life span have modest success and could not clearly describe factors and mechanisms responsible for exceptional longevity, they have important positive implications. These results helped us identify problems that need to be urgently addressed to have further progress in the research field. Why were most of the detected genetic associations with human life span so weak? Why was it so difficult to replicate the research findings using data on independent studies? What are the mechanisms by which genes influence life span? Can one identify mechanisms that link lifespan-affecting genetic variants with health indicators and aging-related changes in biomarkers? How do detected variants interact with other genetic and non-genetic factors to influence life span? To address these questions, efficient approaches capable of studying the dynamic nature of genetic effects on mortality and morbidity risks, as well as on intermediate variables measured in longitudinal data have to be used. The results obtained with the help of one such approach were described in this paper.",

Our aim was to make genetic signals stronger, to evaluate genetic connections among aging-related changes, health, and life span, to elucidate possible reasons for the lack of replication, and to develop useful insights into potential mechanisms of life span regulation. The GWAS performed in these analyses used a modified procedure to control for possible population stratification. Such modification was needed because the traditional procedure may interfere with the process of mortality selection. The confirmation of the genome-wide significant findings in a population of opposite sex (males) in the same (original) cohort and in the offspring generation indicates that these findings are likely to be true-positive. It also indicates that GWAS of human longevity with inappropriate controls for population stratification are likely to suffer from the low level of statistical significance (weak signals) and from the lack of replication.",

Our analyses show that taking this information into account may substantially improve the quality of genetic analyses. Indeed, researchers studying genetics of human life span tacitly assume that population cohorts are genetically heterogeneous with respect to individual susceptibility to death. The aging of individuals in heterogeneous cohorts is accompanied by the process of mortality selection. The genetically vulnerable individuals tend to die first and genetically robust members of the cohort will survive to the old and the oldest-old ages. In Yashin et al. (1999, 2000, 2007, 2013) and Tan et al. (2003), we developed and tested a series of statistical methods for efficient joint analyses of genetic and demographic information in genetic studies of human longevity. The use of such methods allowed us not only to improve estimates of associations between genetic factors and longevity but also to evaluate and compare age patterns of mortality rates for carriers and non-carriers of candidate alleles and genotypes. Such comparisons are not possible using data on genetic frequencies alone.",

These patterns (e.g., when the variant's frequency first declines, then reaches minimum, and then increases) corresponds to a very important property of some genetic variants where their effects on mortality risk change with increasing age from detrimental to beneficial. In this case the mortality curves for carriers and non-carriers of the corresponding genetic variant intersect. Possible reasons for such intersection are discussed in Yashin et al. (2001) and Atzmon et al. (2006). Such a pattern could be responsible for the seemingly paradoxical presence of “risk alleles” for complex diseases in genomes of long-lived people, sometimes reported in literature (e.g., De Benedictis et al., 1998; Bladbjerg et al., 1999; Bonafe et al., 1999; Yashin et al., 1999, 2001b; Beekman et al., 2010; Freudenberg-Hua et al., 2014).

One may argue that the health and longevity traits investigated in this study (i.e., life span and two diseases) are too heterogeneous: individual differences in life spans may depend on susceptibility to different chronic conditions and cause specific mortality risks; cancers of distinct sites are often associated with different genetic and non-genetic factors; the term CVD includes many diseases dealing with cardio-vascular problems, each having its own sets of risk factors; etc. Although these concerns are certainly correct, one often does not have much choice: the selection of a trait for analysis is determined by the available data which has to be enough to get reliable conclusions from the analyses. Studying factors affecting aggregated traits (e.g., cancer of all sites, all-cause, mortality risk, etc.) may help us detect regularities and identify mechanisms that are common for many specific phenotypes (cancers of specific sites, mortality risks by cause, etc.) comprising such traits. An important question is how best to analyze heterogeneous traits when you must? How can an understanding that the trait is genetically heterogeneous affect methods and results of analyses?",

The recommendation that follows from our experience would be to investigate genetic heterogeneity by using different statistical models of the connections between genetic factors and phenotypic traits, to consider how the results of analyses (e.g., sets of selected genetic variants) differ for different quality control procedures, to perform careful studies of the non-replicating results, keeping in mind that different genetic mechanisms may be responsible for the same manifestation of a given trait. The goal of the analyses thus becomes, not just finding the one or more longevity (or vulnerability) alleles/genotypes responsible for the genetic variation of life span in all individuals, but investigating possible alternative mechanisms responsible for developing this trait. These mechanisms may involve different sets of genes in different individuals or in different groups of individuals. The genetic heterogeneity of longevity could be partly responsible for the lack of replication of respective genetic association studies.",

Comparison of functional properties of genes found in this and other genetic studies of aging/longevity indicates that human lifespan may be regulated by different sets of genes; however, these genes tend to be involved in similar biological processes and complex pathology. The fact that the same biological process or health outcome may be realized through the different genes suggests that genes may potentially be interchangeable in their influence on longevity.

Additional studies with a higher quality genetic data are needed to support our conclusions.",
