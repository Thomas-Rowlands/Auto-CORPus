          "text": "Alcohol consumption is a known risk factor for hypertension, with recent candidate studies implicating gene-alcohol interactions in blood pressure (BP) regulation. We used 6882 (predominantly) Caucasian participants aged 20–80 years from the Framingham SNP Health Association Resource (SHARe) to perform a genome-wide analysis of SNP-alcohol interactions on BP traits. We used a two-step approach in the ABEL suite to examine genetic interactions with three alcohol measures (ounces of alcohol consumed per week, drinks consumed per week, and the number of days drinking alcohol per week) on four BP traits [systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP), mean arterial (MAP), and pulse (PP) pressure]. In the first step, we fit a linear mixed model of each BP trait onto age, sex, BMI, and antihypertensive medication while accounting for the phenotypic correlation among relatives. In the second step, we conducted 1 degree-of-freedom (df) score tests of the SNP main effect, alcohol main effect, and SNP-alcohol interaction using the maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) of the parameters from the first step. We then calculated the joint 2 df score test of the SNP main effect and SNP-alcohol interaction using MixABEL. The effect of SNP rs10826334 (near SLC16A9) on SBP was significantly modulated by both the number of alcoholic drinks and the ounces of alcohol consumed per week (p-values of 1.27E-08 and 3.92E-08, respectively). Each copy of the G-allele decreased SBP by 3.79 mmHg in those consuming 14 drinks per week vs. a 0.461 mmHg decrease in non-drinkers. Index SNPs in 20 other loci exhibited suggestive (p-value ≤ 1E-06) associations with BP traits by the 1 df interaction test or joint 2 df test, including 3 rare variants, one low-frequency variant, and SNPs near/in genes ESRRG, FAM179A, CRIPT-SOCS5, KAT2B, ADCY2, GLI3, ZNF716, SLIT1, PDE3A, KERA-LUM, RNF219-AS1, CLEC3A, FBXO15, and IGSF5. SNP-alcohol interactions may enhance discovery of novel variants with large effects that can be targeted with lifestyle modifications.",

          "text": "Hypertension afflicts 77.9 million adults in the United States (Go et al., 2013) and contributes to the public health burden of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases (which cause death, induce functional disabilities, and reduce quality of life) (Roger et al., 2012). While increased awareness and treatment rates have partly alleviated the burden of hypertension, only half of all diagnosed hypertensives achieve their blood pressure (BP) goal (Roger et al., 2012). Dissecting the genetic and environmental architecture of BP regulation may inspire targeted lifestyle and pharmaceutical interventions that improve the prognosis and compliance of hypertensives. Although BP is a highly heritable trait, the identification of BP-associated genes has been slow and arduous compared to other complex traits like lipids. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of BP using up to 200,000 individuals have collectively identified ≈ 50 loci that explain less than 2.5% of the variance in BP (Adeyemo et al., 2009; Levy et al., 2009; Newton-Cheh et al., 2009; Padmanabhan et al., 2010; Ehret et al., 2011; Fox et al., 2011; Ho et al., 2011; Kato et al., 2011; Wain et al., 2011; Guo et al., 2012). The myriad of factors associated with BP, such as age, ethnicity, education, socioeconomic status, weight, physical activity, tobacco use, excessive alcohol consumption, psychosocial stress, and dietary factors (Xin et al., 2001; Go et al., 2013), complicate the dissection of its genetic underpinnings. These demographic and lifestyle factors may modulate the effect of genes on BP.",

          "text": "In this investigation, we focused on the role of alcohol consumption in the genetic and environmental architecture of BP. Alcohol consumption is a modifiable and highly prevalent behavior, as 51.5% of US adults consumed at least 12 alcoholic beverages in the past year (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/alcohol.htm). Excessive alcohol consumption can be curbed to reduce the risk of hypertension (Fuchs et al., 2001; Kodavali and Townsend, 2006); a meta-analysis of 14 randomized clinical trials showed that reducing alcohol consumption in fairly heavy drinkers (>3 drinks per day) reduced systolic BP by 3.31 mmHg and diastolic BP by 2.04 mmHg (Xin et al., 2001). Yet, the effect of light-to-moderate alcohol consumption remains controversial (Klatsky and Gunderson, 2008; Leite et al., 2013) with mounting evidence that the genetic composition of an individual impacts the effect of alcohol consumption on hypertension risk. Candidate gene studies of hypertension and BP have implicated several interactions between alcohol and genes [ADH2 (Sen Zhang et al., 2013), ALDH2 (Chang et al., 2012; Nakagawa et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013), SOD2 (Nakagawa et al., 2013), LEPR (Sober et al., 2009), ApoE (Leite et al., 2013), CYP11B2 (Pan et al., 2010), NADH2 (Kokaze et al., 2004, 2007), GNB3 (Polonikov et al., 2011), and ADM (Chen et al., 2013)].",

          "text": "Interactions between alcohol consumption and genes are biologically plausible, as the intermediate metabolites of alcohol can alter genes directly and influence their expression through epigenetic mechanisms (Alegria-Torres et al., 2011). The most common alcohol metabolism pathway involves two enzymes: alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). Ethanol is first oxidized to acetaldehyde by ADH, then the acetaldehyde is converted to acetate by ALDH, and the acetate is converted to water and carbon dioxide for elimination (National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, 2007). Alcohol consumption can lead to acetaldehyde accumulation, which may be genotoxic (Joenje, 2011) and cause inter-strand crosslinking and other DNA damage (Lorenti Garcia et al., 2009; Joenje, 2011). Chronic alcohol consumption can lead to DNA hypomethylation through reductions in S-adenosylmethionine (Zakhari, 2013). Alcohol metabolism causes an increase in the NADH/NAD + ratio and generates reactive oxygen species and acetate, which can affect histone acetylation (Zakhari, 2013), damage DNA, and modify proteins (Finkel, 2011).",

Thus, we performed a genome-wide analysis of SNP-alcohol interactions on BP traits using 6882 (mostly) Caucasian participants from the Framingham SNP Health Association Resource (SHARe).

The Framingham Heart Study (FHS) was initiated by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to investigate factors associated with the development of cardiovascular disease in a representative sample of the adult population of Framingham, Massachusetts (http://www.framinghamheartstudy.org/about-fhs/history.php). Our Framingham analysis set contained three inter-connected cohorts of mostly Caucasian participants: the Original cohort, the Offspring cohort, and the Third Generation (G3) Cohort. The Original Cohort, launched in 1948, included individuals aged 30–62 undergoing clinical examinations every 2 years (Dawber et al., 1951). The Offspring Cohort, launched in 1971, was formed from the biological descendents of the Original Cohort, as well as the spouses and offspring of the descendents (Feinleib et al., 1975). Following the baseline visit, participants in the Offspring Cohort underwent a second clinical visit 8 years later with subsequent visits every 4 years. The Third Generation Cohort, formed in 2002, included biological descendents or adopted offspring of the Offspring Cohort (Splansky et al., 2007). We analyzed a date-matched set of individuals aged 20–80 years old. The clinic visit dates from the twenty-sixth visit of the Original Cohort (May 1999 to November 2001) and the seventh visit of the Offspring Cohort (September 1998 to October 2001) were closest to each other, with the first visit of the Third Generation Cohort near the same time (April 2002 to July 2005); thus, we pooled the BP measurements from the twenty-sixth visit of the Original cohort (N = 6), the seventh visit of the Offspring Cohort (N ≈ 3000), and the first visit of the Third Generation Cohort (N ≈ 3800) to create a sample roughly analogous to a single-visit family study. Most members of the Original Cohort were beyond 80 years of age by the twenty-sixth exam. The six Original Cohort members that we included were part of extended pedigrees (one was a founder in a pedigree of 307 people). The average ages were 80, 61, and 40 years for the Original, Offspring, and Third Generation Cohorts, respectively.",

A drink was defined as a typical serving size for each particular type of alcoholic beverage, such as a bottle of beer, a glass of wine, or a mixed drink or shot of liquor. The ounces of alcohol consumed per week was derived by Framingham researchers to depict the actual ethanol content consumed; only a certain percentage of an alcoholic beverage is ethanol and this varies by beverage type. We calculated the number of drinks per week by summing the number of drinks per week from each alcohol beverage category. The number of days drinking alcohol per week was a lower bound on their drinking activity: it equaled the maximum days per week an individual drank any one type of alcoholic beverage.

Since the 1 df interaction test statistics exhibited substantial inflation (genomic inflation factors up to 1.73), we applied the widely-accepted genomic control to achieve the expected distribution of p-values (Devlin and Roeder, 1999).

SNP rs10826334 near monocarboxylic acid transporter 9 (SLC16A9) on chromosome 10 significantly interacted with both drinks per week and ounces of alcohol per week to influence SBP. Each copy of the G allele decreased SBP by 3.79 mmHg in individuals consuming 14 drinks per week as opposed to the 0.46 mmHg decrease per copy of the G allele in non-drinkers. Two other loci harbored index SNPs close to genome-wide significance. SNP rs9318552 intronic to RNF219 antisense RNA 1 (RNF219-AS1) on chromosome 13 interacted with ounces of alcohol per week to influence DBP (p-value = 5.3E-08). In non-drinkers, each copy of the T allele decreased DBP by 1.72 mmHg. However, in those drinking 8.4 ounces of alcohol per week (roughly the equivalent of 14 drinks) each copy of the T allele increased DBP by 1.54 mmHg. Thus, the T allele lowered DBP for alcohol consumption below 4.43 ounces of alcohol per week (~7.4 drinks per week) and raised DBP for alcohol consumption above this level. SNP rs13008299 intronic to family with sequence similarity 179, member A (FAM179A) on chromosome 2 interacted with drinks per week to influence DBP (p-value = 7.2E-08).

Seventeen of these loci had failed to produce even suggestive evidence for BP in publicly-released findings from Framingham or other investigations. Our findings may also suggest why alcohol intake interventions may not reduce BP in all patients; some patients may be genetically susceptible to the effects of alcohol on BP and may experience the greatest BP changes with alcohol intake modifications, while others may have little genetic susceptibility and lack any marked BP response to alcohol consumption.",

          "text": "We learned several lessons from this investigation. First, incorporating gene-environment interactions (GEI) enhanced the discovery of variants with large effect sizes. Even among non-drinkers, the estimated effect sizes of three rare/low-frequency variants ranged from 2.28 to 7.28 mmHg per copy of the coded allele. For individuals consuming 14 drinks per week (or ~8.4 ounces of alcohol), variants from eight loci had effect sizes exceeding 2 mmHg per copy of the coded allele. For significant SNP rs10826334, each copy of the G allele decreased SBP by 3.79 mmHg in individuals consuming 14 drinks per week. SNP rs16963349 had the largest effect increasing SBP by 17.56 mmHg for each copy of the rare C allele among consumers of 14 drinks per week. This SNP (intronic to WFDC1) is 574 kb from a known BP variant in the cadherin 13 (CDH13) gene (Levy et al., 2007). Such large effect sizes based on alcohol consumption have been previously reported. For 60 year-old non-smoking apoE ε 2 carriers in Brazil, Leite et al reported that drinkers had a mean SBP 16.5 mmHg higher than non-drinkers whereas among apoE ε 4 carriers there was no difference by drinking status (Leite et al., 2013). In general, our effect estimates for the significant and suggestive variants were consistent with those from other populations. In older Chinese men that consumed alcohol, BP traits varied by as much as 3.5 mmHg based on the genotypes at SNPs in ADH2 and ALDH2 (Sen Zhang et al., 2013). In Japanese men that drank alcohol daily, the effect of a variant in the NADH2 gene was associated with a 4.77 mmHg increase in SBP (Kokaze et al., 2004). Thus, incorporating interactions between genes and environment in the analysis of sequence data may enhance effect sizes, and hence the statistical power, to discover BP variants from the whole allele frequency spectrum using reasonable sample sizes.",

          "text": "The second major lesson was that qualitative (“crossover”) interactions may be more pervasive than previously thought. We discovered twelve suggestive loci with interactions that changed direction of effect with alcohol consumption; in other words, alcohol consumption determined whether these variants increased or decreased BP. This further underscored the importance of incorporating GEI into genetic analyses. Omission of the SNP-alcohol interaction may mask the association between the genetic variant and BP (i.e., the effect of the SNP in drinkers may cancel out the effect of the SNP in non-drinkers) depending on the distribution of alcohol consumption in the sample. Perhaps part of the discordance of association results from previous BP studies can be attributed to differential distributions of environmental factors along with GEIs (Pan et al., 2010). For example, the CYP11B2 variant shown to interact with alcohol by Pan et al. (2010) yielded inconsistent results in previous studies of hypertension; some studies reported that the T allele was associated with hypertension risk while others concluded that the C allele or no alleles were associated with hypertension (Pan et al., 2010). The discovery of qualitative interactions also implies that recommendations concerning alcohol consumption and hypertension risk may need to be personalized based on genotype (Taylor et al., 2009; Green and Guyer, 2011) or focused on high-risk genetic subgroups (Hunter, 2005; Murcray et al., 2009; Thomas, 2010). The incorporation of interactions may increase the accuracy of models predicting individual hypertension risk (Yi, 2010; Chang et al., 2012) and may increase the proportion of BP variance explained by current GWAS findings.",

          "text": "There were a few limitations in this investigation. Alcohol consumption may have been underreported, a phenomenon common among excessive drinkers. The number of drinks per week, the alcohol measure available in the greatest number of participants, is imprecise due to the variability of ethanol content by alcoholic beverage type (beer, wine, hard liquor, etc.). Our analysis was largely restricted to individuals of European ancestry; race was not collected in the Original Cohort and 20% of the Offspring Cohort, thus race was missing for 9.8% of the 6882 individuals analyzed. In addition, one participant reported a non-Caucasian race in the ounces of alcohol consumed per week and days drinking alcohol per week subsamples, with 58 individuals (from 44 families that also contained 1146 Caucasian participants) reporting non-Caucasian races in the drinks per week sample. We analyzed all individuals but adjusted for population stratification through the genomic control method. Candidate gene studies in Japanese, Chinese, and Brazilian populations have reported gene-alcohol interactions (Kokaze et al., 2004, 2007; Pan et al., 2010; Chang et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2013; Leite et al., 2013; Nakagawa et al., 2013; Sen Zhang et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013). Thus, by broadening the investigation of interactions between alcohol and genes to other ethnic groups, we may be able to capitalize on population-specific variants, different distributions of alcohol consumption, and different linkage disequilibrium patterns. We adjusted for antihypertensive use as a dichotomous yes/no predictor; the type of medication, as well as the genetic composition of an individual, may determine the treatment response. In our investigation, the 1 df interaction test suffered from substantial genomic inflation. The genomic control method we used to correct the 1 df interaction tests appeared to overcorrect the tail of the p-value distribution which should harbor true associations (see Figures S4–S7). Thus, we were overly conservative, potentially missing some real associations. Likewise, by not adjusting the 2 df test we may be reporting false positives.",

Lastly, we did not account for genetic variants influencing alcohol metabolism (particularly ADH2, ALDH2). Different variants of the ADH and ALDH enzymes work at different efficiencies, thereby determining the concentration of intermediate metabolites such as acetaldehyde in the body following a given amount of ethanol consumption. A slow ALDH enzyme can cause acetaldehyde accumulation compared to the wild-type ALDH variant (National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, 2007). Thus, by testing SNP-alcohol interactions in individuals with and without the slow ALDH variants, we can test whether the interaction effects of the novel variants are larger when acetaldehyde accumulates. This may help refine the metabolite or mechanism through which the alcohol interactions are occurring.",
