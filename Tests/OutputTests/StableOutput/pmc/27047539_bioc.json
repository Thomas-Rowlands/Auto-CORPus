          "text": "Platinating agents, such as carboplatin, interfere with DNA via inter-strand, intra-strand, and DNA-protein crosslinks, thereby causing DNA damage and prevention of cell division and growth, resulting in cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis (Dekou et al., 2001). Although platinum-based drugs are widely used in cancer treatment, many tumors are completely resistant to these drugs, and no clinical response is attained. Major molecular mechanisms underlying this resistance might involve alteration in platinum inactivation or reduced intracellular accumulation by uptake/efflux transporters, increased repair of adducts, increased adduct tolerance or failure of apoptotic pathway. Taxane agents, such as paclitaxel, are commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs often in combination with platinating agents. Taxanes block cell division by binding to α-tubulin, stabilizing the microtubules, thus resulting in cell death (Huizing et al., 1995; Jordan and Wilson, 2004). The development of taxane resistance is common, where response has been linked to metabolism and disposition molecules, such as, cytochrome P450s and drug transporters (e.g., ABCB1, ABCG2, ABCC1, ABCC2, and SLC01B3; Hewett et al., 2002; Rodriguez-Antona, 2010). In particular, studies in colorectal cell lines and tumor tissue have shown that CYP2C8 may play a role in paclitaxel resistance and the CYP3A may be involved in local inactivation of paclitaxel (Martinez et al., 2002; Garcia-Martin et al., 2006). Additionally, CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 are high involved in the metabolism of paclitaxel in patients with ovarian cancer (Bergmann et al., 2011), while breast cancer patients carrying the *3 variant of CYP2C8 have better response to paclitaxel, but at an increase in peripheral neurotoxicity (Hertz et al., 2012).",

Patient-derived cell line based model systems represent a novel way to identify genomic predictors of drug response. Although lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from participants in the international HapMap project have been used to identify genomic predictors of cytotoxic effects of various chemotherapeutic agents (Li et al., 2008, 2010; Niu et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2011), they are limited as they are not derived from the EOC population but from healthy individuals.",

Overall, we found a greater proportion of significant results (e.g., at p < 10−6) for the combination therapy as compared to the single agent therapies. In particular, we found strong SNP associations with combination therapy in the following gene regions: SLC9A9 (MAF = 0.41, p = 6 × 10−7), TIAL1 (MAF = 0.23, p = 7.3 × 10−7), ZNF731P (MAF = 0.39, p = 6.6 × 10−7), and PCDH20 (MAF = 0.42, p = 8.2 × 10−7).

Additionally, SNPs within CTNNA2 have recently been implicated in breast cancer (Haryono et al., 2015) and its role in tumor progression and metastasis has been suggested for multiple cancers (Mcgranahan et al., 2015).

Overall our results identified germ-line SNPs in multiple cell adhesion molecules and several tumor suppressor genes (PCDH20, LRP1B, CDH4, and CTNNA2). However, none of the most associated SNPs were reported by Huang et al. (2011) or associated with mRNA gene expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/eqtl/index.cgi). Further studies are needed to determine if these SNPs are truly associated with drug response or if they represent false-positive findings. Similar to other studies comparing in vitro chemo-sensitivity with clinical outcomes (Huang et al., 2011; Gamazon et al., 2013), our findings suggest that in vitro response to paclitaxel correlates with time to disease recurrence indicating that this model may have utility in several types of future studies. On possible explanation for the observation that paclitaxel correlates with recurrence and not carboplatin may be the fact that the majority of EOC patients eventually develop platinum resistant tumors and the main factor related to future response maybe attributed to response to taxane therapy. Further research is needed to understand the mechanism by which genomic loci impact clinical response in ovarian cancer patients to the most common regimen used in the treatment of ovarian cancer following surgery.",
