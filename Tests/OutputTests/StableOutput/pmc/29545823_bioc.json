          "text": "Genetic factors likely influence individuals' concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], a biomarker of vitamin D exposure previously linked to reduced risk of several chronic diseases. We conducted a genome-wide association study of serum 25(OH)D (assessed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry) and 386,449 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Our sample consisted of 1,829 participants randomly selected from the Sister Study, a cohort of women who had a sister with breast cancer but had never had breast cancer themselves. 19,741 SNPs were associated with 25(OH)D (p < 0.05). We re-assessed these hits in an independent sample of 1,534 participants who later developed breast cancer. After pooling, 32 SNPs had genome-wide significant associations (p < 5 × 10−8). These were located in or near GC, the vitamin D binding protein, or CYP2R1, a cytochrome P450 enzyme that hydroxylates vitamin D to form 25(OH)D. The top hit was rs4588, a missense GC polymorphism associated with a 3.5 ng/mL decrease in 25(OH)D per copy of the minor allele (95% confidence interval [CI]: −4.1, −3.0; p = 4.5 × 10−38). The strongest SNP near CYP2R1 was rs12794714, a synonymous variant (p = 3.8 × 10−12; β = 1.8 ng/mL decrease in 25(OH)D per minor allele [CI: −2.2, −1.3]). Serum 25(OH)D concentrations from samples collected from some participants 3–10 years after baseline (811 cases, 780 non-cases) were also strongly associated with both loci. These findings augment our understanding of genetic influences on 25(OH)D and the possible role of vitamin D binding proteins and cytochrome P450 enzymes in determining measured levels. These results may help to identify individuals genetically predisposed to vitamin D insufficiency.",

We conducted this work using serum collected from a random sample of women participating in a large prospective cohort study. We re-assessed the top SNPs in an independent set of serum samples from women in the same cohort who later developed breast cancer, and again in serum samples collected from some of the same cases (post-diagnosis) and non-cases 3–10 years after baseline.

A subset of participants, including some who had developed breast cancer and some who had not, were asked to provide a second blood sample and other biospecimens in 2013–2014, 3–10 years after baseline. Further details on the study protocol, which also included extensive questionnaires and additional biospecimens, are available elsewhere (Sandler et al., 2017).

We calculated Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium p-values and examined our top hits for evidence of disequilibrium, but did not exclude SNPs based on these results. We regressed 25(OH)D on the number of copies of the minor allele for each of these SNPs using linear least-squares. The values of 25(OH)D looked normally distributed. We adjusted each model for age at blood draw (in years), self-reported race/ethnicity [Non-Hispanic White (n = 1,576), Black (n = 134), Hispanic (n = 81), or other (n = 38)] and genetic ancestry (proportion CEU, YRI, or CHB) (O'Brien et al., 2017a) and calculated the genomic control inflation factor (λ) to test for evidence of uncontrolled confounding due to population stratification. We also conducted sensitivity analyses adjusting for estimated total vitamin D intake at baseline (dietary plus supplement) and hours spent outdoors per year, as these both contribute to variations in measured 25(OH)D concentrations.

Therefore, given their high correlations with rs4588 (r2 = 0.97 and 0.77, respectively), these previously identified SNPs may just be tags for rs4588, which may be a variant that causally impacts 25(OH)D concentrations. This possibility is supported by a number of candidate gene studies that have reported strong associations between rs4588 and measured 25(OH)D (Engelman et al., 2008; Lu et al., 2012; Perna et al., 2013; Robien et al., 2013; Li et al., 2014; Nissen et al., 2014).

In our sample, carriers of the Gc2-coding haplotypes had the lowest 25(OH)D concentrations (Table ​(Table3).3).

The rare SNP with the strongest association in the sub-cohort, rs117913124 (MAF = 0.02), also results in a synonymous substitution in CYP2R1 (exon 4) and in a recent whole genome sequencing analysis (Manousaki et al., 2017), this variant was strongly associated with vitamin D even after adjusting for more common, previously-identified SNPs in the same region. Earlier GWAS for serum 25(OH)D identified 5 genome-wide significant SNPs on chromosome 11 near CYP2R1 (rs10741657, rs2060793, rs11023332, rs12287212, rs1007392) (Ahn et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2010; Anderson et al., 2014; Jiang et al., 2018). Of these previous GWAS hits, we assessed rs10741657 and rs11023332 (p = 4.9 × 10−8 and p = 1.5 × 10−11, respectively, in the pooled sample). The former is close to rs12794714 (1.3 kb upstream), but is intergenic and the two are only loosely correlated (r2 = 0.40 in our sample). The latter is further away from rs12794714 (129 kb downstream), but is more strongly correlated (r2 = 0.90) and results in a silent substitution in PDE3B. None of the other previously identified hits is an obvious candidate for a causal association: rs1007392 is an intron variant of PDE3B, rs2060793 is located upstream of CYP2R1, and rs12287212 is intergenic. Though many candidate gene studies have assessed the association between 25(OH)D and rs12794714 or other highly correlated SNPs, there is no clear consensus as to the likely causal variant(s) (Ramos-Lopez et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2012, 2013; Robien et al., 2013; Batai et al., 2014; Ordóñez-Mena et al., 2016). Previously documented ancestral heterogeneity in allele frequencies and measured associations contribute additional uncertainty (Batai et al., 2014; Elkum et al., 2014). Assessments of expression quantitative trait loci showed that the genome-wide significant SNPs in this region were only associated with expression of genes in the direct vicinity (CYP2R1, RRAS2, COPB1, CALCB, and PDE3B)2.",

However, we saw little difference in our results when we assessed women who later became cases vs. the random sub-cohort and our top hits and their effect estimates are consistent with findings of previous studies.",

They may also help to identify individuals who are genetically predisposed to lower 25(OH)D and would most benefit from interventions to improve their circulating vitamin D levels.",
