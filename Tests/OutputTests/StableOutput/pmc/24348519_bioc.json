The phenotype is highly heritable. Family and twin studies have shown that between 40 and 70% of the inter-individual variation in obesity can be attributable to genetic factors (Maes et al., 1997). In recent years, large-scale GWAS have identified many loci associated with Body Mass Index (BMI), the most common measure of obesity, but these loci combined explain only 2–4% of the heritability (Speliotes et al., 2010). Thus far, four waves of GWAS studies for BMI identified 32 loci that reached genome-wide significance and unequivocally were associated with BMI in a large meta-analysis performed by the GIANT (Genetic Investigation of ANtropometric Traits) consortium (Frayling et al., 2007; Scuteri et al., 2007; Loos et al., 2008; Willer et al., 2009; Speliotes et al., 2010; Loos, 2012; Mägi et al., 2013). The firstly identified locus, FTO (fat mass and obesity associated gene), has the largest effect on obesity-susceptibility with obesity at a risk of 1.20 fold. Moreover, the frequency of the BMI-increasing allele is high in white Europeans (i.e., 40%). As a consequence, of all 32 BMI-associated loci, the FTO locus explains the largest proportion of the inter-individual variation in BMI (0.34%; Speliotes et al., 2010; Loos, 2012).",

We successfully utilized anthropomorphic measures to calculate BMI-for-age percentile, derived BMI-z scores according to CDC growth charts, performed quantitative trait locus GWAS study and conducted meta analyses. The overall adjusted meta-analysis result of 2860 European samples produced the best signal in the 16q12 genomic region at the first intron of the FTO locus for a cluster of SNPs. The best typed marker rs8050136 produced [p(Rec) = 7.34 × 10-8), z = 5.26] and with no heterogeneity between cohorts (p = 0.77). When the tail distribution was considered (≥95% as case and ≤20 as control), an OR of 1.61 (95% CI = 1.313–1.965, p = 4.04 × 10-6) was detected. Notably, this OR estimate in our data was relatively higher than previous adult studies (OR = 1.2; Loos, 2012). In any case, considering the effect size (or OR) at the range of 1.2 and the high MAF of the FTO loci (0.40) in Europeans, 700 samples were sufficient for us to achieve an optimum power of 0.8 with a type 1 error level of 0.05. In fact, genetic variants in the first intron of FTO present as the strongest BMI-associated GWAS locus in humans. Over the past few years, the association of the FTO locus has been repeatedly replicated, not only for BMI, but also for obesity risk, body fat percentage, waist circumference, and other obesity-related traits, in particular type II diabetes (Scuteri et al., 2007; Frayling et al., 2007). Recent association with dyslipidemia, hypertension, reduced brain volume, Alzheimer’s disease, and dementia has also been reported that could be confounded with obesity and vascular complications (Pausova et al., 2009; Keller et al., 2011).",

          "text": "The functional mechanism of FTO however is still elusive and is currently the subject of intense interest. It is an AlkB-like, Fe(II)- and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent nucleic acid demethylase that has been shown to demethylate 3-methylthymine and 3-methyluracil in single-stranded DNA and RNA, respectively (Gerken et al., 2007). A link between FTO demethylase activity and increased fat mass was suggested by recent animal studies. Notably, homozygous mutant fto-/- mice show postnatal growth retardation and a significant reduction in adipose tissue and lean body mass, an observation that also was supported by the deleterious mutation Ile367Phe in mouse FTO protein with an impaired activity from a separate study (Church et al., 2009; Gao et al., 2010). In both studies, the leanness of fto-deficient mice seems to be the result of increased energy expenditure and systemic sympathetic activation. Interpreting energy expenditure from these results, however, was challenging because of body composition differences and growth retardation. Overall, these experimental data suggest that inactivation of the FTO gene protects from obesity. On the other hand, mice globally overexpressing FTO are obese, hyperphagic, and exhibit normal energy expenditure when corrected for lean tissue mass (Church et al., 2010). Most human studies also report that obesity-predisposing FTO alleles are associated with increased food intake, but not energy expenditure (Speakman et al., 2008; Haupt et al., 2009). Although the detailed mechanisms are still not clear, this is suggested to be the result of increased expression of FTO in humans, due to cis-regulatory variation in intron 1 of this gene which is consistent with the mouse models, in which decreased levels of FTO cause a lean body habitus (Zabena et al., 2009; Berulava and Horsthemke, 2010). Moreover, a positive correlation of FTO gene expression with other adipocytokine gene expressions, including leptin, perilipin, and visfatin, has also been shown (Haupt et al., 2009).",

This effect was unique to the FTO locus, while use of a dominant model was best near the MC4R region (Table ​(Table3).3). Indeed, between-study variations in regard to the optimal inheritance model of the FTO polymorphisms have been noticed previously. In one study, eight different meta-analysis results of BMI in women with polycystic ovary syndromes were systematically reviewed and the recessive model was found to fit best in half of them and the additive model worked best in the rest (Wojciechowski et al., 2012). In our pediatrics population in which we had an enrichment of earlier age of obesity with a prevalence rate of 28%, a recessive pattern may be more relevant in comparison to the general population. Under this model, another intron-1 marker, rs1421085, produced the best result p(Rec) = 8.21 × 10-9, z = 5.78 (Table ​(Table3;3; r2 = 0.93 with rs8050136). Indeed, the variant rs1421085 is particularly interesting. It is located within a highly conserved element and the risk allele C has been predicted to substantially reduce binding affinity for CUX1, a transcription factor implicated in the regulation of FTO (Stratigopoulos et al., 2011; Peters et al., 2013).",

Specifically, at early ages (up to 5–7 years), the association between common variation at FTO and BMI appears to be reduced in magnitude (Hardy et al., 2010). Longitudinal twin studies also suggest that with increasing age loci such as FTO may be able to exert a greater effect on BMI which depends on the influence of shared environmental effect and the timing of adiposity rebounds (Haworth et al., 2008; Sovio et al., 2011). In our cohorts when we divide all samples into two strata of less than 5 and above 5 years old, we didn’t observe any opposing effect, however a higher magnitude was identified for strata above 5 years old (OR = 1.72) (Figure ​Figure22).

Of note, six out of eight cases had structural heart defect with cardiomyopathy. This would appear consistent with our unique observation of a negative association of obesity-predisposing FTO alleles with cardiomyopathy [p(corr) = 0.0009, OR = 0.53 (95% CI 0.37–0.77)] that could result in lower expression of FTO; although further studies with larger sample sizes are necessary to confirm or refute this finding. In fact, to our knowledge, no SNP in intron 1 of FTO has been previously associated with any trait unrelated to BMI. Recently, an independent effect at the eighth intron of the FTO locus has been reported to be associated with melanoma (GenoMEL Consortium et al., 2013). The best marker, rs16953002, was replicated using 12,313 cases and 55,667 controls of European ancestry in a study conducted by the GenoMEL consortium (combined P = 3.6 × 10-12, OR = 1.16). Notably, in their study, none of the BMI related SNPs in intron 1 were associated with melanoma. Similarly, in our collection, there was no effect observed at the eighth intron of the FTO gene with BMI (p = 0.54 for rs16953002, r2 < 0.01 with rs8050136).

Because of their lower effect on BMI and obesity risk (OR ~1.10, in adult meta-data) and lower allele frequency, the identification of these loci requires a quadrupling of the sample size in a random population. Finding all of these loci in our pediatric collections, despite limited sample size, indicate the enrichment of the genetic signal to noise ratio given the shorter amount of time that environment has had an effect.",

This marker produced an OR of 2.90 when the tail distributions (>95% as case and <20% as control, 386 cases, and 572 controls) was considered as binary phenotype. Considering this level of OR (2.90), even with MAF of 5%, 500 samples were sufficient for us to achieve the extraordinary power (0.99) with a type 1 error level of 0.05. This could be considered as one of the rare obesity risk loci that we expect to detect in these special cohorts. The α5-containing collagen VI (Col6A5, COL29A1), belongs to the class of collagens containing von Willebrand factor type A domains. These collagens form filaments with globular domains containing vWA motifs, which are involved in protein-ligand interactions for the organization of tissue architecture and cell adhesion. Collagen VI is a major extracellular matrix (ECM) protein with a critical role in maintaining skeletal muscle functional integrity. It has been suggested that type VI collagen is a fibrotic component that restricts adipose tissue expandability. In humans, Col6A3 gene expression in adipose tissues was found to correlate with visceral adipose tissue mass and pro-inflammatory gene expression (Pasarica et al., 2009). Mutations in different families of this gene have also been associated with myopathy and muscular dystrophy. Recently, it has been shown that COL6A5 is involved in adhesion at myotendinous and dermal–epidermal junctions (Sabatelli et al., 2012). Different polymorphisms in or near this gene have been linked to atopic dermatitis and eczema, but with contradictory reports (Söderhäll et al., 2007; Naumann et al., 2011). In our cohorts, the number of samples with Atopic dermatitis and related conditions (ICD-9 = 691) was only 49 with a trend of association for published SNP rs7629719 (p = 0.14); adjusting the results based on presence or absence of atopy, didn’t have any effect on overall BMI associations. A larger sample size is necessary to further elucidate this coexistent condition and to determine whether COL6A5 has any role in obesity related conditions.",

We have removed all inconsistent data and outliers to the best of our ability. We have also excluded infants and those less than 2 years old because of the complexity of growth chart pattern and many potential maternal effects on infants from perinatal periods. In addition we assessed the distribution of BMI-z in the whole population with a large sample size as a quantitative trait rather than attempting to identify limited cases and controls. From the statistical standpoint, quantitative traits usually are preferred in meta-GWAS studies because they improve power to detect a genetic effect and often have a more interpretable outcome (Bush and Moore, 2012). Furthermore, BMI is a highly heritable trait in humans and, as mentioned above, up to 70% of the inter-individual variation in obesity can be attributable to genetic factors per se (Maes et al., 1997); therefore, given the strong genetic confirmation described here, indeed, we managed to repurpose the genotyping data collected for the analyses of another phenotype and successfully find association between the new phenotype and genotypic data.",
