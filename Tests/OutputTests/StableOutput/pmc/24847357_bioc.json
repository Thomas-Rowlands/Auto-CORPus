It is a leading cause of invasive bacterial infection that contributes to substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide. This bacterium can cause a variety of diseases ranging from mild to severe skin and soft tissue infections, keratitis, and osteomyelitis to life-threatening bacteremia, pneumonia, endocarditis, and sepsis (Lowy, 1998; Rehm, 2008). Even though S. aureus colonizes human anterior nares and other sites on skin in 30–50% of the general population (Graham et al., 2006; Kuehnert et al., 2006; Gordon and Lowy, 2008), not everyone who is colonized gets infected. One reason could be differences in genetic susceptibility to colonization and infections. The established role of host susceptibility in other infectious diseases lends support for a role of host genetics in S. aureus infection (de Bakker and Telenti, 2010). Genetic susceptibility to S. aureus infections is expected to be complex because this pathogen uses a wide variety of virulence factors that interact with several host pathways to cause disease in humans.",

We performed a case/control GWAS on a subgroup of the PMRP population: 3234 subjects (309 cases/2925 controls). All study subjects were over 49 years of age. Cases were defined as individuals who had at least one laboratory confirmed test in their medical record of a disease caused by S. aureus. Controls were subjects who did not have any evidence of infection due to S. aureus in their EMR. We reasoned that because cases had to have evidence of laboratory confirmed S. aureus infection in the EMR, patients with no evidence of infection in the EMR would form an ideal control group. The results using our control group are likely very similar to those that would be obtained using population-based controls, as is often employed in GWAS studies (Burton et al., 2007). Only subjects with self-identified Northern European ancestry were included; therefore, both cases and controls had the same genetic ancestry. Additionally, a principal components analysis of their genome-wide genotypes in all study subjects (without knowledge of case/control status) was performed, revealing no evidence of population substructure (Supplemental Figure 1). With this filtered set of case/control subjects, we performed three levels of statistical analysis: SNP-based, Gene-based, and Pathway-based, to identify novel polymorphisms, genes, and pathways involved in susceptibility to S. aureus diseases. This hierarchical investigation of genetic effects allows for the incorporation of a gradation of biological information into the statistical tests—the SNP-based scan is the most comprehensive and agnostic to prior biological knowledge, the gene-based analysis uses positional information and collapses effects from the same protein-coding region, and the pathway-based analysis incorporates information obtained from various molecular biology studies.",

All SNPs annotated to a gene were used in the calculation, and the method adjusted by the linkage disequilibrium structure by using HapMap data. Monte Carlo simulations from multivariate Gaussian random variables and Cholesky decomposition matrices were employed by VEGAS to produce disease association p-values per gene, correcting for the correlation structure between nearby SNPs. This type of analysis has several advantages including the collapsing of effects for all genotyped SNPs within each gene, and reducing the multiple testing burdens. The LD structure of each gene region is factored into the analysis through applying decomposition matrices in the analysis, effectively factoring-out the correlational structure between tightly linked SNPs. Additionally, gene-based results enable the subsequent use of many pathway analysis packages designed to use a single measurement from each gene.",

The MSCRAMMS can bind to fibronectin, fibrinogen, and platelets among others.

In contrast, the Danish middle-aged/elderly twin study showed that host genetics had a modest influence only on S. aureus carrier state (Andersen et al., 2012). While our manuscript was under review, a study by Nelson et al did not find any SNP that has genome wide significance for association with S. aureus bacteremia (SAB) although an intronic SNP in CDON was speculated to be associated with complicated SAB (Nelson et al., 2014). In a report by Stappers et al., four SNPs from three toll-like receptor (TLR) genes, TLR1, TLR2, and TLR6, increase the susceptibility to complicated skin and soft tissue infections caused by staphylococci, streptococci, and enterococci (Stappers et al., 2014).",

S. aureus is known to induce apoptosis of host cells during host invasion, leading to a compromised host immune response (Haslinger-Löffler et al., 2005). XRN1 encodes a 5'–3' exonuclease family member involved in cellular mRNA turnover (Nagarajan et al., 2013).

Mammalian hosts are known to reduce the level of free zinc to thwart pathogen growth (Kehl-Fie and Skaar, 2010) and it is plausible that SLC39A8, a zinc transporter, could be involved. BCL11B encodes a transcriptional repressor involved in T-cell development (Wakabayashi et al., 2003). NMRK2, an integrin beta1 binding protein, could function in host responses to bacterial function based on the finding that host fibronectin forms a bridge between S. aureus fibronectin-binding proteins and host cell beta1 integrins during S. aureus cellular invasion (Fowler et al., 2000). Keratin intermediate filaments are shown to have a protective role during infection with Bartonella henselae in cat scratch disease (Zhu et al., 2013).

While no one SNP and gene was found to be highly significant in this study, we suspect that for a versatile pathogen like S. aureus, that needs to overcome barriers presented by a variety of tissues and defense systems to infect various sites in the body, there are bound to be several genes involved in host susceptibility. Not everyone exposed to a virulent or a colonizing strain of S. aureus has similar severity of infection. It is reasonable to speculate that effects of variants segregating at multiple genes contribute to the severity of S. aureus infection. Similarly, there could be protective alleles that may lower the risk of clinically-attended infection as well. Additional studies will be needed to confirm these findings but eventually functional studies will be needed to illuminate the detailed mechanisms of how these variants confer predisposition to infection. Once consensus disease loci and pathways are identified, they can serve as targets for future pharmaceutical development and further elucidation of how aberrant cellular processes/signaling give rise to Staphylococcus-induced pathologies.",
