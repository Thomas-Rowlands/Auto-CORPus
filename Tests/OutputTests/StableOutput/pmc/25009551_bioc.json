To adjust for population stratification, we used principal components to identify outliers in the study cohort (Price et al., 2006). Quantile-quantile (QQ) plots of observed –log10\nP-values for PAD association versus the expected –log10\nP-values under the null hypothesis of no association were generated to display the potential significant associations and to calculate the genomic inflation factor λ and to check for over dispersion of the test statistics. For each locus, we determined the set of HapMap SNPs in linkage disequilibrium (LD) (r2 > 0.5) with the most significantly associated SNP. We then bounded the associated interval by the flanking HapMap recombination hotspots. These windows are likely to contain the causal variants explaining the associations. We used logistic regression analyses that adjusted for age and sex to identify the SNPs associated with PAD case/control status in the discovery, replication, and combined sets. All analyses were forced to test the same allele as the original sample. We performed sensitivity analyses by including additional adjustment variables for smoking, CHD, statin use, diastolic and systolic blood pressure, and diabetes. Since the additional adjustment variables did not have a qualitative impact on the final inferences, the results are not shown.",

Comparative protein sequence analyses using wild type and mutant sequences indicated that that rs3184504 leads to substitution of tryptophan with arginine (W262R) thereby introducing a new cAMP phosphorylation site in the PH domain of SH2B3 (see Supplementary Data and Figure S5). The PH domain in SH2B3 is important for lipid binding, membrane tethering and protein-protein interactions. GO terms (Ashburner et al., 2000) that are enriched among proteins interacting with SH2B3 include blood coagulation; wound healing, and cell signaling events (see Supplementary Data, Table S2 and Figure S6). Conservation measures like Genomic Evolutionary Rate Profiling (GERP: 2.97) and phastCons (posterior probability: 0.159) suggest the variant is marginally conserved. Effect prediction analysis using Variant Effect Predicator (McLaren et al., 2010) indicate the variant as tolerant (SIFT: score = 1) benign (PolyPhen-2; score = 0.0), and moderately radical (GRANTHAM; score = 101).

Conventional linkage and association approaches have failed to identify replicable susceptibility loci for PAD (Leeper et al., 2012) and the genome-wide association approach is currently the most promising design to uncover such loci. Heritable factors contribute to the risk of developing PAD. In the large population-based Swedish Twin Registry (Wahlgren and Magnusson, 2011), the odds ratio of having PAD in persons whose twin had PAD compared with persons whose twin did not have PAD was 17.7 (95% CI, 11.7–26.6) for monozygotic twins and 5.7 (95% CI, 4.1–7.9) for dizygotic twins. In a large case control study we found that family history of PAD was associated with doubling the odds of the presence of PAD (Khaleghi et al., 2014). Heritability estimates for ABI have varied from 0.21 (Kullo et al., 2006; Murabito et al., 2006) to 0.48 (Carmelli et al., 2000). In spite of evidence supporting the presence of heritable contribution to PAD, little is known about the genetic determinants of PAD.",

This SNP is in near-complete LD with a missense SNP in SH2B adaptor protein 3 gene (SH2B3) (rs3184504; r2 = 0.99) that is likely the causal SNP. The SNP in SH2B3 results in a substitution of tryptophan (large size and aromatic side chain) by arginine (large size and basic side chain) that induces changes in the structure and hydrophilic properties of the pleckstrin homology domain. This may result in altered lipid binding and protein–protein interactions as indicated by our molecular dynamics analyses. The variant also introduces a new phosphorylation site in the pleckstrin homology domain which may influence signaling pathways mediated by SH2B3. The SNP rs3184504 exhibits significant pleiotropic effects and has been implicated in immunological disorders, cardiovascular diseases (Gudbjartsson et al., 2009) and hematologic traits such as platelet count, mean-platelet volume (Gieger et al., 2011) and eosinophil count (Barrett et al., 2009).

SH2B3 is also involved in platelet production via megakaryocyte development; mice lacking SH2B3 (Lnk/SH2B3−/−) (Kwon et al., 2009) have altered platelet function and thrombus development (Tong et al., 2005). The relatively high frequency of this SNP in the general population is speculated to be due to a protective effect against bacterial infection (Zhernakova et al., 2010).

A synonymous SNP (rs1051730) within the cholinergic receptor nicotinic alpha 3 gene (CHRNA3) was significantly associated with PAD (OR = 1.19).

The ATXN2-SH2B3 locus was not associated with PAD in this study. One possible explanation may be the differences in case ascertainment, the present study including symptomatic PAD patients from the clinical setting whereas in the meta-analyses by Murabito et al, most individuals had undergone ABI measurement as part of prospective cohort studies. Koriyama et al. (2010) found the OSBPL10 locus to be associated with PAD in a Japanese cohort.
