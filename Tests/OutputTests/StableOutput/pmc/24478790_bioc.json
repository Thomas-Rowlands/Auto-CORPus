          "text": "Leukocyte telomere length is believed to measure cellular aging in humans, and short leukocyte telomere length is associated with increased risks of late onset diseases, including cardiovascular disease, dementia, etc. Many studies have shown that leukocyte telomere length is a heritable trait, and several candidate genes have been identified, including TERT, TERC, OBFC1, and CTC1. Unlike most studies that have focused on genetic causes of chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes in relation to leukocyte telomere length, the present study examined the genome to identify variants that may contribute to variation in leukocyte telomere length among families with exceptional longevity. From the genome wide association analysis in 4,289 LLFS participants, we identified a novel intergenic SNP rs7680468 located near PAPSS1 and DKK2 on 4q25 (p = 4.7E-8). From our linkage analysis, we identified two additional novel loci with HLOD scores exceeding three, including 4.77 for 17q23.2, and 4.36 for 10q11.21. These two loci harbor a number of novel candidate genes with SNPs, and our gene-wise association analysis identified multiple genes, including DCAF7, POLG2, CEP95, and SMURF2 at 17q23.2; and RASGEF1A, HNRNPF, ANF487, CSTF2T, and PRKG1 at 10q11.21. Among these genes, multiple SNPs were associated with leukocyte telomere length, but the strongest association was observed with one contiguous haplotype in CEP95 and SMURF2. We also show that three previously reported genes—TERC, MYNN, and OBFC1—were significantly associated with leukocyte telomere length at pempirical < 0.05.",

Individuals with short leukocyte telomere length are at an increased risk of age-related diseases (e.g., cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, dementia, cancer) and premature subsequent death compared with similarly aged individuals with longer telomeres (Jeanclos et al., 1998; Epel et al., 2004; Aviv, 2009, 2012; Kaplan et al., 2009; Honig et al., 2012; Shaffer et al., 2012; Ye et al., 2013).

As with most complex traits, multiple genetic variants along with environmental and lifestyle factors are likely to contribute to familial longevity. Genome wide linkage studies have identified four chromosomal regions, 14q23.2, 10q26.13, and 3p26.1 (Andrew et al., 2006), and 12p11 (Vasa-Nicotera et al., 2005) that may harbor loci that influence leukocyte telomere length. Genome wide association studies (GWAS), and meta-analysis across several studies in multiple populations have revealed several candidate genes: TERC, telomerase RNA component (Codd et al., 2010), located on 3q26 (Soerensen et al., 2012), and TERT, telomerase reverse transcriptase (5p15.33) (Hartmann et al., 2009; Soerensen et al., 2012). A meta-analysis (Mangino et al., 2012) identified CTC1 (conserved telomere maintenance component 1, 17p13.1) and ZNF676 (zinc finger protein 676, 19p12) as candidate genes for telomere homeostasis in humans, and confirmed that minor variants of OBFC1 on 10q24.33 was associated with shorter leukocyte telomere length. Although their function is not certain, these genes appear to be involved in maintenance of chromosome structures.",

Briefly, the LLFS is a multicenter study with recruitment from four centers, Boston University Medical Center, Boston, MA, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY; University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA; and University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark. Nearly 5,000 Caucasian subjects from families with strong evidence for familial longevity had been recruited and examined (Sebastiani et al., 2009). The ascertainment strategy for the Denmark cohort differed slightly from US sites. Individuals who were at least 90 years of age during the study recruitment period were identified in the Danish National Register of Persons (Pedersen et al., 2006). Using the parental information on birth place, names, and parish registers available in regional archives, sibships were identified and, potentially eligible families were identified and contacted to assess the family's eligibility and willingness to participate in the LLFS using the criteria parallel to those used in the US. Of those, 4289 individuals from 586 families had measures of leukocyte telomere length and were included in the genome wide association and linkage analyses.",

Assay method was optimized for use of both telomere (T) and single copy gene (S) amplifications on the same 384-well plate, with reference standard DNA samples on each plate. Test DNA samples each underwent two triplicate PCR reactions, with use of “calibrator samples” for correction for inter-plate variability.

Of 20 PCs, only PC8 was included in the linear mixed model because it was found to be significant at p < 0.05 in the multivariate polygenic model described above. This mixed linear model adjusted for relatedness among family members by incorporating the kinship coefficient matrix using the R functions written by Therneau (Therneau et al., 2012). In addition, to confirm previously reported genes, we examined the regions containing the previously reported genes and applied the linear mixed effects model as above, but we ‘shuffled’ the phenotype 500 times to obtain empirical p-values at three different levels to correct for multiple testing: SNP-wise, gene-wise, and then experiment wise p-values. To obtain gene wise p-values, we shuffled the phenotypes and computed p-values to establish the distribution of smallest p-values for 500 replicates, and then counted the number of replicates that exceeded the nominal p-values for the SNPs within a gene. To obtain the experiment wise p-value, we then extended the approach we used for gene-wise estimation to include all genes.",

Specifically, sets of up to five tightly linked SNPs within 0.5 cM intervals were haplotyped with ZAPLO, generating a set of SNP “super-loci” spaced ~0.5 cM apart and having greater information content than individual SNPs. From these haplotypes, Loki (Heath, 1997) was used to estimate multipoint IBD in intact pedigrees, which was then imported into SOLAR for variance component linkage analysis. Because different quantitative trait loci (QTLs) influencing leukocyte telomere length are likely to segregate in different families (i.e., genetic heterogeneity), admixture (heterogeneity) LOD scores (HLOD) were completed using SOLAR (Blangero et al., 2001, 2013; Almasy and Blangero, 2010). This algorithm computes HLOD using the algorithm by C. A. B Smith in which the null hypothesis of homogeneity is compared to the hypothesis of heterogeneity (Smith, 1961; Ott, 1983). The admixture linkage analysis identified two linkage peaks—17q23.2 and 10q11.21—that had HLOD exceeding 3 when all families were included in the analysis. When restricted to linked families, HLODs increased to 5.86 for 17q23.2 and 9.69 for 10q11.21 as expected. This finding suggests that subsequent sequencing experiments can be prioritized to include these families.",

This model adjusts for the same set of covariates as in the linear mixed model and also controls for familial correlation by including kinship coefficient in the model. famSKAT tests whether multiple rare variants contribute to phenotypic variation, and does not assume that all rare variants influence phenotypes in the same direction with the same effect size. Taking one step further, we then applied measured genotype analysis to identify genetic variants that were significantly associated with variation in leukocyte telomere length. In addition, haplotype analysis was conducted when contiguous multiple variants were associated with leukocyte telomere length.

Genome wide linkage analysis followed by gene-wise association analysis identified CEP95 (Centrosomal protein 95 kDa) and SMURF2 (SMAD specific E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 2) as promising candidate genes. SMURF2 is shown to be involved in regulation of neuronal and cell polarity, induction of cellular senescence, and tumor suppression (Blank et al., 2012), suggesting its potential role in cellular aging. On the other hand, very little is known about CEP95. However the shared haplotype encompassing these two genes is a strong candidate region for sequencing. In addition, KCNH6 (potassium voltage-gated channel, subfamily H (Ether-A-Go-Go-Related), member 6) belongs to a class of voltage-gated ion channels and is believed to be involved in regulating release of neurotransmitters, controlling heart rate, secretion of insulin, neuronal excitability, etc. (http://genecards.org).",

Specifically, we found at least one SNP in TERC, ARPM1, MYNN, OBFC1, and ZNF729 to be nominally associated with variation in leukocyte telomere length; however, TERC, MYNN, and OBFC1 were significantly associated with leukocyte telomere length based on a permutation test at the gene-wise level. Moreover, MYNN was significant at experiment-wise level. For these genes, different variants were significantly associated with leukocyte telomere length, except for MYNN, where rs1317082 (p = 0.000372) (Mangino et al., 2012) was previously reported.",

          "text": "Several possibilities may explain the differences in findings across studies, including selection, leukocyte telomere length measurements, differences in the distribution of risk factors, etc (Aviv et al., 2006; Christensen et al., 2006; Armanios and Blackburn, 2012; Sanders et al., 2012). First, cellular aging as measured by leukocyte telomere length is likely to be a complex trait. As such, a different set of genetic and environmental risk factors can influence variation in leukocyte telomere length in different cohorts. The LLFS cohort was sampled to recruit families with strong evidence for familial longevity, and this cohort appears to be relatively healthier than other elderly cohorts (Newman et al., 2011). Previously, Newman et al. (2011) showed that compared with other large epidemiologic cohorts (including Cardiovascular Health Study, the Framingham Heart Study, and the New England Centenarian Study), the prevalence of diabetes, chronic pulmonary disease and peripheral artery disease was lower in LLFS family members and the levels of biomarkers (e.g., pulse pressure, triglycerides, HDL, and gate speed) were more favorable. In addition, the heritability estimates for leukocyte telomere length in this cohort ranged from 0.47 for the older proband generation to 0.85 for the relatively younger offspring generation with an overall estimate of 0.54. These estimates are comparable to those observed in the meta-analysis based on 19,713 subjects by Broer et al. (2013) which observed an overall heritability of 0.70, with 0.62 for the Netherlands Twin Registry and Queensland Institute Medical Research Twin study and 0.86 for the Leiden Longevity Study. However, given the difference in recruitment for LLFS compared with other studies, it is likely to yield a different set of candidate genes than in other datasets that have been ascertained for familial aggregation of heart disease or a random set of twins, for example. Moreover, there likely to exist substantial differences in life style or the distribution of environmental risk factors in these families selected for familial longevity compared with cohorts recruited based on diseases of interest. With the exception of age, sex, Caucasian ancestry, and atherosclerosis (Sanders and Newman, 2013), the strength and direction of association between leukocyte telomere length and risk factors are equivocal. Thus, to minimize the influence of these risk factors on allelic association, the present study adjusted for potential confounders, including age, sex, education, site, smoking, alcohol consumption, marital status, a history of heart disease, and one principle component because they were significantly associated with leukocyte telomere length in the LLFS dataset. Second, the telomere assays used across studies vary (Sanders and Newman, 2013). This study measured leukocyte telomere length using the quantitative PCR method (T/S ratio) (Cawthon, 2002; Cawthon et al., 2003; Honig et al., 2012), rather than the terminal restriction fragment method (TRF) (Aviv et al., 2011). The impact of methodological difference on the genetic findings is likely to be minimal. Studies that compared these two methods showed that the T/S ratio method measures only “canonical” TTAGGG telomere repeats, while the TRF method derives a “telomere” measurement including telomere-adjacent non-canonical sequences. However, over a wide-range, T/S measurements linearly relate to TRF measurements, as shown by many investigators, including Cawthon et al. (2003), Honig et al. (2012), and Aviv et al. (2011). This study supports comparability of the two methods by confirming the previously reported genes. Lastly, because the present study ascertained healthy families selected for familial longevity, there exist very few studies with such extreme sampling exist. Therefore, the present study lacks extensive replication since reported associations vary widely depending on study design (e.g., case-control vs. family based or randomly selected samples vs. extreme samples, etc.).",
