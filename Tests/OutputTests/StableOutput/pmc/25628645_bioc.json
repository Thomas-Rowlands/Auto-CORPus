Since response to HHT varies among patients, our study aimed to identify biomarkers that might influence the response to HHT using a panel of various human lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). Genome-wide association (GWA) analysis using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and mRNA expression data was assessed for association with cytotoxicity to HHT in LCLs. Integrated analysis among SNPs, expression, AUC value was also performed to help select candidate genes for further functional characterization. Functional validation of candidate genes was performed using leukemia cell lines (U937, K562). Candidate genes were knocked down using specific siRNA and its response to HHT was assessed using MTS assay. We found that 15 expression probes were associated with HHT AUC with P < 10−4, and 96 individual probe sets with P < 10−3. Eighteen SNPs were associated with HHT AUC with P < 10−5 and 281 SNPs with P < 10−4. The integrated analysis identified 4 unique SNPs that were associated with both expression and AUC. Functional validation using siRNA knockdown in leukemia cell lines showed that knocking down CCDC88A, CTBP2, SOCS4 genes in U937 and K562 cells significantly altered HHT cytotoxicity. In summary, this study performed with LCLs can help to identify novel biomarker that might contribute to variation in response to HHT therapy.",

It has been widely used in China for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) for more than 3 decades. In the United States, the semi-synthesized HHT, known as Omacetaxine, has been approved by FDA in the setting of CML after failure of 2 or more tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (Kantarjian et al., 2013). HHT exhibits its anti-leukemic effects in myeloid leukemia primarily through inhibition of protein synthesis, cell proliferation and by enhancing apoptosis of leukemic cells (Zhou et al., 1995; Yinjun et al., 2004; Tang et al., 2006).",

Based on these observations, investigators in China attempted to add HHT into the conventional induction therapy (anthracycline plus cytarabine regimen) in newly diagnosed patients with AML to improve therapeutic outcomes. A multicenter randomized controlled phase 3 trial was carried out to assess the efficacy and safety of HHT-based induction treatment. Results showed that HHT in combination with cytarabine and aclarubicin (HAA regimen) or daunorubicin (HAD regimen) improved both overall complete response (CR) rate and estimated 3-year overall survival in de novo AML patients under the age of 57 years. However, the addition of HHT also increased early death rate due to more severe marrow suppression (Jin et al., 2013). These findings raised a question of when HHT should be used in AML chemotherapy. If we can find biomarkers that can predict the response to HHT, then we can decide whether we should add HHT into conventional regimen. Selection of patients predicted to respond to HHT would maximize drug efficacy while minimizing drug-related toxicity.",

In recent years, the application of high-throughput genomic techniques makes it possible to identify variation across genome that may help to find biomarkers responsible for drug sensitivity (Sachidanandam et al., 2001; Morley et al., 2004; Sabeti et al., 2007). In addition, expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies performed using gene expression profiles have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with drug response through their influence on gene expression.

As described previously, we have obtained genomic information for these LCLs involving approximately 1.3 million SNPs per cell line, 54,613 mRNA expression probe sets. We also have performed genome-wide imputation using 1000 Genomes Project data in these LCLs. We next performed a HHT cytotoxicity assay with the same LCLs to obtain HHT area under the curve (AUC) as an in vitro HHT response phenotype. After genome-wide association (GWA) analysis involving single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), mRNA data and also integrated analysis of SNPs, gene expression and AUC.

These data are publicly available from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) under Super Series accession numbers GSE24277 and GSE23120. Briefly, DNA from all the LCLs was genotyped using Illumina HumanHap 550K and 510S Beadchips, which assayed 561,303 and 487,407 SNPs, respectively. We also obtained publicly available Affymetrix SNP array 6.0 Chip SNP data involving 906,367 SNPs for the same cells to give us even better coverage. Quality control (QC) was performed for all of these SNPs prior to performing statistical analysis. Specifically, for data obtained with the Illumina 550K array, we removed 11,258 SNPs that had call rate <95%, 33,237 SNPs with minor allele frequencies (MAF) <5%, and 49 SNPs that deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). Therefore, 516,759 Illumina 550K SNPs were used in the genome-wide SNP analysis. The same approach was used for the QC analysis of SNPs on the Illumina 510S platform which resulted in a total of 336,070 SNPs remained for analysis. QC analysis was also performed for the publicly available Affymetrix 6.0 SNPs. After removing 32,515 SNPs with call rate <95%, 133,553 SNPs with MAF <5%, and 324 SNPs that deviated from HWE, a total of 739,395 SNPs remained. After removing redundant SNPs genotyped on both Affy and Illumina platforms, 1,366,022 SNPs obtained from both platforms were available for the GWAS analysis. Genome-wide imputation was then performed in LCLs. Specifically, SNPs that were not genotyped but found in the multi-race (ALL) of the1000 genomes project (11/23/2010 released version) were imputed by race using BEAGLE v3.3.1 (Browning and Browning, 2007). SNPs in the 1000 genomes project with MAF <0.01 were excluded as well SNPs with BEAGLE imputation dosage R2 quality measure <0.3 were excluded from the further analysis, which resulted in a total of 5,384,559 imputed markers.

To construct the partial correlations, an adjusted AUC was constructed as the standardized residuals from a linear regression of Van der Waerden transformed AUC values regressed on gender, race and sub-race variables. Gene expression was first normalized using GCRMA (Ballman et al., 2004; Wu et al., 2004); log2 transformed normalized expression was then likewise regressed on gender, race and sub-race variables. SNP genotype was modeled as count of rare alleles, then regressed on gender, race and sub-race variables. Variables addressing possible population stratification (sub-race variables) were created from linkage disequilibrium thinned genome-wide SNPs using principle components analysis within each race (Price et al., 2006). The top 5 principle components were used within each race, thus analyses were adjusted for labeled cell line race and sub-racial features within each race (Li et al., 2008; Niu et al., 2010). For siRNA transfection experiments, group mean value for AUC and gene expression was compared by using Student's t-test.",

Many pharmacogenomic studies have successfully used LCL models to illustrate the contribution of germline genetic variations to variation in chemotherapeutic drug response. For example, using the LCL system, previous findings have identified potential biomarkers for response to a series of drugs including Ara-C, 5-FU, Asparaginase, Daunorubicin (Watters et al., 2004; Huang et al., 2007; Peters et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2011). In some cases, findings from the LCLs were further validated in clinical studies. FKBP5, which was found as a biomarker of Ara-C response using the LCL system, was further studied at mechanistic levels showing that FKBP5 promoted the dephosphorylation of AKT and downregulated the AKT activity, which in turn, increased cytotoxicity by triggering apoptosis in the presence of Ara-C (Pei et al., 2009). These findings were validated in a clinical study, in which SNPs within FKBP5 were genotyped in a cohort of 187 pediatric acute myeloid leukemia patients treated with Ara-C. Two of the SNPs were associated with both event-free and overall survival (Mitra et al., 2011). Based on the potential impact of these findings in individualizing chemotherapy, we aimed to use this well-established LCLs model to find biomarkers responsible for HHT cytotoxicity.",

AKT activation regulates DNA replication and cell proliferation by phosphorylating the downstream effectors GSK3 and FOXO1/FKHR. The PI3K/AKT and mTOR signaling pathways are activated in acute myeloid leukemia (Park et al., 2010). Although the mechanism responsible for CCDC88A involvement in HHT response is unclear, given the roles of AKT in the development of leukemia, it was not surprising that this gene might play a role in variable response to HHT. However, we recognized that the CCDC88A had a positive association with HHT cytotoxicity in LCLs, while our knockdown showed the opposite effect, which might be due to the difference between LCLs and Leukemia cell lines. Further mechanistic studies will be needed to confirm the results. The protein encoded by SOCS4 belongs to the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS), also known as STAT-induced STAT inhibitor (SSI), protein family. SOCS family members are known to be cytokine-inducible negative regulators of cytokine signaling, including JAK1/STAT3 pathway. SOCS4 has been also demonstrated to regulate EGFR signaling in vitro (Chan et al., 2009). Therefore, regulation of both pathways could contribute to HHT cytotoxicity. CTBP2 gene produces alternative transcripts encoding two distinct proteins. One protein is a transcriptional repressor, while the other isoform is a major component of specialized synapses known as synaptic ribbons. Transcription corepressor CTBP2 has been reported to directly bind acinus, which is regulated by NGF (nerve growth factor), inhibiting its stimulatory effect on cyclin A1 expression in leukemia (Trengove and Ward, 2013). Although there is limited information with regard to the involvement of these genes to HHT response, our results suggest a possible role for their relationship with variation in HHT response. Further mechanistic studies of these genes as well as additional association studies in patients treated with HHT are needed to validate the genes as biomarkers of HHT response.",
