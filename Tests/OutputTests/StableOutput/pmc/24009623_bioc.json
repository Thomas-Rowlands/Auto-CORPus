This study aimed to identify novel biomarkers and mechanisms that might influence the response to Rapamycin and Everolimus. Genome-wide association (GWA) analyses involving single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), mRNA, and microRNAs microarray data were assessed for association with area under the cytotoxicity dose response curve (AUC) of two mTOR inhibitors in 272 human lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). Integrated analysis among SNPs, expression data, microRNA data and AUC values were also performed to help select candidate genes for further functional characterization. Functional validation of candidate genes using siRNA screening in multiple cell lines followed by MTS assays for the two mTOR inhibitors were performed. We found that 16 expression probe sets (genes) that overlapped between the two drugs were associated with AUC values of two mTOR inhibitors. One hundred and twenty seven and one hundred SNPs had P < 10−4, while 8 and 10 SNPs had P < 10−5 with Rapamycin and Everolimus AUC, respectively. Functional studies indicated that 13 genes significantly altered cell sensitivity to either one or both drugs in at least one cell line. Additionally, one microRNA, miR-10a, was significantly associated with AUC values for both drugs and was shown to repress expression of genes that were associated with AUC and desensitize cells to both drugs. In summary, this study identified genes and a microRNA that might contribute to response to mTOR inhibitors.",

          "text": "The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a kinase acting downstream of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, is a critical regulator of basic cellular functions and plays an important role in tumor progression. Activated mTOR as a response to nutritional status promotes cell growth, proliferation, motility, and metabolism (Guertin and Sabatini, 2005; Petroulakis et al., 2006) through the regulation of a wide range of cellular activities, including translation, transcription, mRNA turnover, protein stability, actin cytoskeletal organization, and autophagy (Jacinto and Hall, 2003; Inoki et al., 2005). The best characterized function of mTOR in mammalian cells is regulation of protein translation through key downstream effectors of mTOR complex 1 (TORC1), the ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K) and eukaryote initiation factor 4E binding protein (4EBP1). S6K is the major ribosomal protein S6 kinase in mammalian cells. Phosphorylation of the S6 protein by S6K selectively increases the translation of mRNAs containing a tract of pyrimidines motif, which encode ribosomal proteins and other translation regulators, thereby enhancing the overall translation capacity of the cells (Meyuhas, 2000; Inoki et al., 2005). 4EBP1 acts as a translational repressor by binding and inhibiting the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (elF4E), which recognizes the 5′-end cap of eukaryotic mRNAs (Cho et al., 2005; Richter and Sonenberg, 2005). Phosphorylation of 4EBP1 by mTOR results in the dissociation of 4EBP1 from elF4E, thereby relieving the inhibition of elF4E-dependent translation initiation by 4EBP1.",

          "text": "Since aberrant activity of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is commonly observed in cancer, mTOR inhibitors (e.g., Everolimus, Deferolimus, and Temsirolimus) have emerged as promising therapeutic agents for the treatment of a variety types of cancer, including renal-cell carcinoma, breast carcinoma, non-small-cell lung carcinoma, endometrial carcinoma, glioblastoma, and mantle cell lymphoma (Chapman and Perry, 2004; Rowinsky, 2004; Vignot et al., 2005; Hartford and Ratain, 2007). However, mTOR inhibitors have severe adverse effects such as nephrotoxicity and potential immune suppression (i.e., skin reactions, mucositis, and myelosuppression) (Rowinsky, 2004; Guertin and Sabatini, 2005; Vignot et al., 2005). Many factors contribute to mTOR drug response, with genetic variation being one major factor. To maximize the efficacy and safety of mTOR inhibitors, there is a critical need to identify genetic biomarkers for response and to elucidate specific mechanisms by which these biomarkers might be involved in response to mTOR inhibitors.",

In addition to cytotoxicity represented by the dose response curves (AUCs) for the two mTOR inhibitors, we have also obtained extensive genomic information for these LCLs, including approximately 1.3 million SNPs, 54,613 mRNA expression probe sets and 228 microRNA probe sets. This model system has previously been utilized successfully to identify genetic biomarkers associated with drug response for a variety of anti-cancer agents (Li et al., 2008, 2009; Pei et al., 2009; Niu et al., 2010), as well as to interpret GWAS signals identified during clinical pharmacogenomic studies of aromatase inhibitor induced musculoskeletal adverse events (Ingle et al., 2010). In this study, we performed genome-wide association (GWA) analyses among SNPs, mRNA expression, microRNA expression, and cytotoxicity phenotypes, as measured by AUC values, for two mTOR inhibitors to identify candidate genes or microRNAs that might contribute to variation in response to mTOR inhibitors.

Cytotoxicity phenotypes were determined by the best fitting curve using the R package “drc” (dose response curve) (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/drc.pdf) based on a logistic model, either 4 parameter logistic, 4 parameter logistic with top = 100%, or 4 parameter logistic with bottom = 0%. The AUC phenotype was determined using the best fitting curve by numerically determining the area under the curve from dose 10−7 nM to 1 μM. Since the LCLs represent variation from different sexes and races, the AUC phenotype was Van der Waerden transformed, adjusted for sex, race, and population stratification as previously described (Li et al., 2008; Niu et al., 2010), and standardized for association analysis. SNP data was assessed by population stratigication using the method described by Price et al. (2006). In addition, expression array data was adjusted on standardized residuals for gender, race and batch after Log2 transformation and GCRMA normalization (Ballman et al., 2004; Wu et al., 2004). MicroRNA probes were transformed using a van der Waerden transformation followed by adjusting for all the factors as expression data. Pearson correlations were calculated to quantify the association between adjusted SNPs and AUC values. Similar correlation analyses were also performed between AUC values with normalized and adjusted mRNA expression microRNA data. False discovery rate Q-values (Storey, 2003, 2002) were computed for each test. For siRNA and miR-10a transfection experiments, group mean values for AUC and gene expression were compared by using Student's t-test.",

Therefore, those 9 genes were tested further for the effect of miR-10a on gene regulation. HOXA1, a known target for miR-10a, was used as a positive control gene (Mansfield et al., 2004; Garzon et al., 2006). All of the genes (including the positive control, HOXA1) were regulated by miR-10a in the same manner: miR-10a mimic significantly suppressed gene expression, while miR-10a inhibitor rescued gene expression (P < 0.05), as shown in Figure ​Figure5E.5E. Four of those 9 genes (PHLDA1, FBXW7, NDUFAF2, and MGLL) were shown to have an effect on response to Rapamycin or Everolimus in one or more cell lines (Table ​(Table2).2). Down-regulation of 3 of the 4 genes (all except NDUFAF2) desensitized the cells to mTOR inhibitors. In addition, Rapamycin treatment significantly enhanced miR-10a expression in a dose dependent manner (Figure ​(Figure5C,5C, P < 0.05), suggesting that miR-10a might be suppressed by mTORC1 activation. We also tested the effect of miR-10a on mTORC1 signaling by measuring phosphorylated S6K and 4EBP1 and found that knockdown or overexpression of miR-10a did not result in a change of mTORC1 activity (data not shown).",

          "text": "The LCLs have limitations, as we have previously discussed (Niu et al., 2010). For example, EBV transformation can induce chromosomal instability and cellular changes (Sie et al., 2009). In addition, other factors such as cell growth rate and ATP level can have an effect on cytotoxicity (Choy et al., 2008). Since these cell lines do not necessarily represent the response of other types of tissues or cells (Dimas et al., 2009), we selected the top candidate genes based on our analyses to determine their contribution to variation in response to mTOR inhibitors. Two clinically relevant tumor cell lines, renal carcinoma (Caki2) and glioblastoma (U87), were selected for functional validation (Supplementary Figures S2, S3) since mTOR inhibitors are used as a treatment for these two types of tumors (Pantuck et al., 2006; Brugarolas et al., 2008; Cloughesy et al., 2008) and because our data suggested that these two cell lines were relatively more sensitive to mTOR inhibitor treatment. A fibroblast cell line (IMR90) was also included as a comparison to the tumor cell lines (Supplementary Figure S4). The two tumor cell lines, Caki2 and U87, tended to show similar results for several of the genes tested: ECOP, MGLL, and MAN1B. Our study showed that knockdown of these genes sensitized both Caki2 and U87 cells to mTOR inhibitors. ECOP (EGFR-coamplified and overexpressed protein), a gene which is amplified and overexpressed in at least a third of glioblastomas with EGFR amplification (Eley et al., 2002), is known to be a key regulator of NF-κB transcriptional activity that can contribute to cell survival (Park and James, 2005). IMR90 cells, on the other hand, seemed to be impacted by a different panel of genes, BTG2, FBXW7, NDUFAF2, PHLDA1, and DMD, whose knockdown did not have a significant impact in the two tumor cell lines, suggesting cell line-specific effects. Many of these genes have not been previously reported to interfere with the mTOR pathway except for FBXW7 (F-box and WD repeat domain containing 7), which is known to target mTOR for degradation and which cooperates with PTEN for tumor suppression (Mao et al., 2008), and BTG2 (B-cell translocation gene 2), which has been reported to inhibit AKT phosphorylation and mTOR signaling. Our results were compatible with the conclusion that down-regulation of FBXW7 restored the target for mTOR inhibitors, thus sensitizing cells to mTOR inhibitors, while knockdown of BTG2 activated the mTOR pathway which might cause the cells to become “addicted” to the mTOR pathway and, therefore, to benefit from mTOR inhibition. It is also worth noting that knockdown of ZNF765 (zinc finger protein 765) was found to sensitize cells to mTOR inhibitors in both the IMR90 and U87 cell lines (Table ​(Table2).2). ZNF765 is located on chromosome 19 and little is known with regard to its function. Therefore, its involvement in the mTOR pathway and response to mTOR inhibitors needs to be investigated further in the future.",

          "text": "Besides mRNA expression and SNPs, other genetic mechanisms, such as copy number variation, epigenetic effects (CpG methylation sites) and microRNAs might also influence response to mTOR inhibitor (Shenouda and Alahari, 2009). Despite the well-recognized importance of microRNAs and mTOR in cancer, very few studies have linked microRNAs with mTOR activity. MiR-99 was reported to mediate down-regulation of mTOR/FGFR3 and suppress tumor growth; miR-100 is known to inhibit mTOR signaling and enhance sensitivity to Everolimus in clear cell ovarian cancer (Nagaraja et al., 2010; Oneyama et al., 2011); and mTORC1 was recently reported to regulate miR-1 in skeletal myogenesis (Sun et al., 2010). Therefore, in this study we also attempted to determine whether microRNA might affect response to mTOR inhibitors. One microRNA (miR-10a) was shown to desensitize response to mTOR inhibitors (Figure ​(Figure5D),5D), and also affected the expression of several candidate genes that influenced sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors (Figure ​(Figure5E).5E). MiR-10a, a member of the miR-10 family members, maps to chromosome 17 upstream of the HOX gene cluster and putatively regulates expression of the HOXA1, HOXA3, and HOXD10 genes (Garzon et al., 2006; Han et al., 2007). It is upregulated in glioblastoma, anaplastic astrocytomas and hepatocellular carcinoma (Ciafre et al., 2005; Gaur et al., 2007; Lund, 2010), and is known to be involved in the development of chronic and acute myeloid leukemia (Agirre et al., 2008; Jongen-Lavrencic et al., 2008). We also demonstrated that miR-10a can be induced by mTOR inhibitors and that genes highly associated with miR-10a were all negatively regulated by miR-10a. Based on this evidence, we hypothesize that mTOR inhibitors upregulate miR-10a expression, which in turn desensitizes cells to mTOR inhibitors response. This process probably occurs through the regulation of a set of genes whose expression levels are also critical in determining mTOR inhibitor response (Supplementary Table S7). Therefore, upregulation of miR-10a might be one mechanism for acquired resistance after Rapamycin therapy. Among the 9 genes that we tested, 5 had predicted binding sites for miR-10a. However, several genes were found experimentally to be negatively regulated by miR-10a, which was not consistent with the positive association values between miR-10a and mRNA expression (ex. FBXW7, R = 0.367; STAU1, R = 0.273; PHLDA1, R = 0.431, etc) observed in our LCLs. This might be due to the different cell specificity in terms of transcription regulation. We have also shown that inhibition of mTOR by Rapamycin upregulated miR-10a (Figure ​(Figure5C),5C), a process that might create a feedback loop resulting in desensitization of cells to mTOR inhibitors. However, the exact mechanisms by which miR-10a determines mTOR inhibitor response still need to be investigated in future studies.",

Functional validation of these candidates demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing this cell-line based model system and a GWA approach to generate hypotheses. These findings might help to enhance our understanding of the regulation of the mTOR pathway and of the mechanisms underlying variation in response to mTOR inhibitors. Obviously this study represents an early attempt to trying to identify biomarkers for response to mTOR inhibitors. These candidates can now be tested in clinical settings in future studies and, if confirmed, these studies could enhance our ability to individualize treatment with mTOR inhibitors.",
