More powerful methods must be developed to identify G × E. The “adaptive combination of Bayes factors method” (ADABF) has been proposed as a powerful genome-wide polygenic approach to detect G × E. In this work, we evaluate its performance when serving as a gene-based G × E test. We compare ADABF with six tests including the “Set-Based gene-EnviRonment InterAction test” (SBERIA), “gene-environment set association test” (GESAT), etc. With extensive simulations, SBERIA and ADABF are found to be more powerful than other G × E tests. However, SBERIA suffers from a power loss when 50% SNP main effects are in the same direction with the SNP × E interaction effects while 50% are in the opposite direction. We further applied these seven G × E methods to the Taiwan Biobank data to explore gene× alcohol interactions on blood pressure levels. The ADAMTS7P1 gene at chromosome 15q25.2 was detected to interact with alcohol consumption on diastolic blood pressure (p = 9.5 × 10−7, according to the GESAT test). At this gene, the P-values provided by other six tests all reached the suggestive significance level (p < 5 × 10−5). Regarding the computation time required for a genome-wide G × E analysis, SBERIA is the fastest method, followed by ADABF. Considering the validity, power performance, robustness, and computation time, ADABF is recommended for genome-wide G × E analyses.",

Searching for genes that may modify drug responses will significantly improve drug delivery by identifying subjects that can benefit from therapy and those at an increased risk of harm (He and Allen, 2010; Chen et al., 2011; Ko et al., 2015).

If cases are ascertained, more E = 1 and SNP = 2 combinations will be observed in cases, representing that SNP and E will be positively associated in cases. Assuming SNP and E are approximately independent in controls, they will be also positively associated in the combined case-control data (Jiao et al., 2013). Similarly, if there is a negative interaction between SNP and E, they will be negatively associated in the combined case-control data. Therefore, for rare-disease studies with ascertained cases, the association between SNP and E in combined case-control samples can be an efficient filtering statistic for detecting SNP × E interaction (Murcray et al., 2011).
