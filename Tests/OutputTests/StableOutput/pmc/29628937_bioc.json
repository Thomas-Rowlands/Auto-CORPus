          "text": "Blood levels of growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15), also known as macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1), have been associated with various pathological processes and diseases, including cardiovascular disease and cancer. Prior studies suggest genetic factors play a role in regulating blood MIC-1/GDF-15 concentration. In the current study, we conducted the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) to date using a sample of ∼5,400 community-based Caucasian participants, to determine the genetic variants associated with MIC-1/GDF-15 blood concentration. Conditional and joint (COJO), gene-based association, and gene-set enrichment analyses were also carried out to identify novel loci, genes, and pathways. Consistent with prior results, a locus on chromosome 19, which includes nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (top SNP, rs888663, p = 1.690 × 10-35), was significantly associated with blood MIC-1/GDF-15 concentration, and explained 21.47% of its variance. COJO analysis showed evidence for two independent signals within this locus. Gene-based analysis confirmed the chromosome 19 locus association and in addition, a putative locus on chromosome 1. Gene-set enrichment analyses showed that the“COPI-mediated anterograde transport” gene-set was associated with MIC-1/GDF15 blood concentration with marginal significance after FDR correction (p = 0.067). In conclusion, a locus on chromosome 19 was associated with MIC-1/GDF-15 blood concentration with genome-wide significance, with evidence for a new locus (chromosome 1). Future studies using independent cohorts are needed to confirm the observed associations especially for the chromosomes 1 locus, and to further investigate and identify the causal SNPs that contribute to MIC-1/GDF-15 levels.",

Studies have shown that the expression of MIC-1/GDF-15 in both humans and animals is restricted under resting conditions but can be induced in most cells or tissues by oxidative and nitrosative stress (Unsicker et al., 2013; Wallentin et al., 2014). Animal studies suggest that MIC-1/GDF-15 is anti-inflammatory (Breit et al., 2011) and neuroprotective (Strelau et al., 2000), promotes longevity (Wang et al., 2014a) and neurogenesis (Kim et al., 2015), and inhibits atherosclerosis development (Johnen et al., 2012). In humans, MIC-1/GDF-15 circulates in the blood of all individuals with levels of about 200-1200 pg/ml, with the concentration increasing with age (Wiklund et al., 2010). Higher MIC-1/GDF-15 blood levels have been associated with a variety of diseases and conditions including inflammation (Brown et al., 2007), cardiovascular disease (Brown et al., 2002), various types of cancer [e.g., prostate (Brown et al., 2009), colon (Wallin et al., 2011), melanoma (Boyle et al., 2009), pancreas (Wang et al., 2014b)] neurodegeneration and cognitive decline (Jiang et al., 2016), and all-cause mortality (Wiklund et al., 2010).",

No other genome-wide significant loci were identified from the current study, but we observed suggestive evidence for a locus on chromosome 1.

Interestingly, on inspection of the GWAS Central catalog, many of the top SNPs have been nominally associated with various phenotypes, including pulmonary function, proinsulin levels, fibrinogen, fasting insulin, inflammatory bowel disease, breast cancer, and BMI (Supplementary Table 9).

A few factors may contribute to the lack of replication of all of the findings. The participants of the replication cohort, Sydney MAS, are the most elderly of the four participating cohorts, and MIC-1/GDF-15 blood concentration has been shown to increase steadily with age (Wiklund et al., 2010), possibly because of aging-related chronic, low-grade inflammation (Franceschi and Campisi, 2014). This may have weakened the contribution of genetic factors in determining MIC-1/GDF-15 blood concentration in this aged cohort. It is noteworthy that the three replicated SNPs are the only SNPs that reached genome-wide significance in PIVUS, which shares a similar age range (but still ∼8 years younger in average age) with Sydney MAS.

          "text": "Gene-based association analyses identified four chromosome 19 and three chromosome 1 genes associated with MIC-1/GDF-15 blood levels. Of the four chromosome 19 genes, PGPEP1 is a cytosolic cysteine peptidase that is involved in neurophysiological processes in the synaptosomal and myelinic fractions of human and rat brains (Larrinaga et al., 2005). LRRC25 contributes to the detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns during innate immune sensing (Ng et al., 2011). Consistent with the current findings, variation in the PGPEP1 and LRRC25 genes has been associated with MIC-1/GDF-15 blood levels in the previous MIC-1/GDF-15 GWAS (Ho et al., 2012). MIR3189 is a novel, p53-regulated micro RNA (miRNA) located in the intron of MIC-1/GDF15, which is also targeted by p53. It inhibits the expression of cell-cycle-control- and cell-survival-related genes, as well as many p53 inhibitors leading to upregulated MIC-1/GDF15 gene expression (Jones et al., 2015). Moreover, in p53-deficient cells, MIR3189 overexpression also elevates MIC-1/GDF15 gene expression. In addition to the chromosome 19 genes, gene-based association analyses also revealed that a locus on chromosome 1 showed a suggestive association with MIC-1/GDF-15 blood concentration, which is mainly due to the SNP rs3813199. This variant is located in the intron of the SDF4 gene, which encodes a stromal cell derived factor belonging to the CREC family (Scherer et al., 1996), with involvement in regulating calcium-dependent cell activities (Chen et al., 2016). The SNP, rs3813199, is also an eQTL for B3GALT6, whose protein modulates heparin sulfate, which binds to unprocessed MIC-1/GDF-15 in the extracellular matrix (Bauskin et al., 2005), and therefore may affect MIC-1/GDF-15 deposition and processing in local tissues, and its blood levels. In addition, B3GALT6 is associated with progeria, which is consistent with the previously observed association between MIC-1/GDF-15 and longevity (Wang et al., 2014a).",

MIR3189 (chr19) is also an interesting candidate gene, which is located within the MIC-1/GDF-15 gene, given the evidence discussed above. The tentative chromosome 1 locus also deserves more investigation, with the intronic SDF4 SNP, rs3813199, an attractive candidate as it may affect the binding of several transcription factors and is an eQTL in blood for B3GALT6 and TNFRSF18, which have been implicated in MIC-1/GDF-15 protein binding and immune function respectively. The question also arises as to whether the products of the identified genes, such as LRRC25, are involved in the regulation of MIC-1/GDF-15 protein levels. Indeed, LRRC25 has recently been described as a negative regulator of the NF-κB signaling pathway that regulates gene expression, including inflammation and immunity (Feng et al., 2017). It is also noteworthy to mention that eQTLs for MIC-1/GDF-15 in blood have been identified (GTEx) but were not significant in the current study.

For example, plasma samples acquired from NSPHS participants were non-fasting, which may introduce fluctuations in MIC-1/GDF-15 measurement as it varies in a diurnal pattern (Tsai et al., 2015), and therefore may have added heterogeneity to the analyses. Second, the participating cohorts are of different age ranges. Since older age is a potent risk factor for elevated MIC-1/GDF-15 blood levels, a comparable age range across all participating cohorts will minimize the age effect. Third, the definition of DM was not identical across all participating cohorts, which may introduce biases to the results. Fourth, the LD of the European reference panel used for COJO analyses may not perfectly match the study samples, which may therefore introduce potential biases to COJO analyses results. Fifth, diseases known to elevate MIC-1/GDF-15 blood levels, such as renal disease and rheumatoid arthritis, are not comprehensively documented throughout all participating cohorts. Therefore, although our community-dwelling cohorts are generally healthy, we could not exclude the possibility that up-regulation of blood MIC-1/GDF-15 levels due to these diseases may influence the observed associations. Sixth, a larger sample size would enable relatively weaker associations to be observed. Finally, the HapMap2 reference panel does not include the most up-to-date set of genetic variants. Future use of more up-to-date panels such as the 1000 Genome reference panel for imputation, will facilitate a more comprehensive set of variants to be examined.",

The findings also suggest that a few additional genes on chromosome 19 and 1, and the COPI-mediated anterograde transport pathway, may be involved in regulating MIC-1/GDF-15 blood levels. This work suggests that the regulation of blood MIC-1/GDF-15 levels is complex with genetic variation playing a significant role. Our results warrant further independent studies to confirm the observed relationships, and to investigate the biological mechanisms underlying the findings, given the negative health outcomes linked to MIC-1/GDF-15 blood levels in humans.",
