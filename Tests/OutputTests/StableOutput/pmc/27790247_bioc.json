          "text": "Age-related diseases may result from shared biological mechanisms in intrinsic processes of aging. Genetic effects on age-related diseases are often modulated by environmental factors due to their little contribution to fitness or are mediated through certain endophenotypes. Identification of genetic variants with pleiotropic effects on both common complex diseases and endophenotypes may reveal potential conflicting evolutionary pressures and deliver new insights into shared genetic contribution to healthspan and lifespan. Here, we performed pleiotropic meta-analyses of genetic variants using five NIH-funded datasets by integrating univariate summary statistics for age-related diseases and endophenotypes. We investigated three groups of traits: (1) endophenotypes such as blood glucose, blood pressure, lipids, hematocrit, and body mass index, (2) time-to-event outcomes such as the age-at-onset of diabetes mellitus (DM), cancer, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), and (3) both combined. In addition to replicating previous findings, we identify seven novel genome-wide significant loci (< 5e-08), out of which five are low-frequency variants. Specifically, from Group 2, we find rs7632505 on 3q21.1 in SEMA5B, rs460976 on 21q22.3 (1 kb from TMPRSS2) and rs12420422 on 11q24.1 predominantly associated with a variety of CVDs, rs4905014 in ITPK1 associated with stroke and heart failure, rs7081476 on 10p12.1 in ANKRD26 associated with multiple diseases including DM, CVDs, and NDs. From Group 3, we find rs8082812 on 18p11.22 and rs1869717 on 4q31.3 associated with both endophenotypes and CVDs. Our follow-up analyses show that rs7632505, rs4905014, and rs8082812 have age-dependent effects on coronary heart disease or stroke. Functional annotation suggests that most of these SNPs are within regulatory regions or DNase clusters and in linkage disequilibrium with expression quantitative trait loci, implying their potential regulatory influence on the expression of nearby genes. Our mediation analyses suggest that the effects of some SNPs are mediated by specific endophenotypes. In conclusion, these findings indicate that loci with pleiotropic effects on age-related disorders tend to be enriched in genes involved in underlying mechanisms potentially related to nervous, cardiovascular and immune system functions, stress resistance, inflammation, ion channels and hematopoiesis, supporting the hypothesis of shared pathological role of infection, and inflammation in chronic age-related diseases.",

          "text": "Common age-related diseases including cancer, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), diabetes mellitus (DM), and neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia are major contributors to morbidity and mortality at old age. The underlying hypothesis in gerontology posits that these devastating diseases share some common mechanisms in intrinsic processes of aging that remain to be determined (Kaeberlein et al., 2015). Identifying genetic variants associated with multiple age-related diseases (i.e., pleiotropic effects) is a fundamental step toward understanding the genetic contribution to age-related processes. Numerous loci have been identified to show association across distinct diseases such as immune-related disorders, cancer and NDs, highlighting the common underlying biological pathways in the etiology of these complex diseases (Sivakumaran et al., 2011). For example, variants in APOE significantly associated with longevity and lifespan also confer risk of CVDs, AD and cancer (Ewbank, 2002; Christensen et al., 2006; Brooks-Wilson, 2013; Kulminski et al., 2014, 2015a). A putative loss of function variant in PTPN22 has been found to reduce the risk of Crohn's disease but to increase the risk of rheumatoid arthritis and DM (Plenge et al., 2005; Todd et al., 2007; Barrett et al., 2008). On the other hand, evidence suggests that many age-related diseases are associated with a variety of intermediate phenotypes (also called endophenotypes, i.e., a hereditary characteristic that normally relates to some condition but is not a direct symptom per se) such as body mass index (BMI), lipids, etc. It has been noted from previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that different diseases and endophenotypes can be linked by shared genetic variants (Li et al., 2014). These observations demonstrate the clinical benefits from characterization of shared genetic causes that have pleiotropic effects on different phenotypes related to aging. Thus, there has been an increasing interest in jointly interrogating the cross-phenotype association of genetic variants.",

          "text": "Pleiotropic analysis generally provide more information on the common underlying biological mechanism and guidance of further functional studies (Solovieff et al., 2013; Price et al., 2015). In many cases, considering multiple phenotypes together boosts statistical power by aggregating marginal effects on individual phenotypes. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with moderate causal effects on each phenotype may happen not to reach significance when interrogating them separately. Multi-trait analysis has been demonstrated to yield enhanced statistical power for detecting the quantitative trait loci (QTL) that are associated with multiple traits (Korol et al., 2001). Moreover, once genetic pleiotropy is identified, it is of interest to further discriminate between a biological and mediated pleiotropy (Solovieff et al., 2013). The former refers to a direct independent biological effect of a variant on more than one phenotype, while the latter refers to a situation in which the effect on one phenotype is mediated by another phenotype so that the variant is indirectly associated with the second. Given the identified genetic variant having pleiotropic effect on a pair of phenotypes, causal inference under certain specific assumptions can provide insights into potential causal pathways and contribute to characterizing the underlying biological mechanisms. For example, given the causal relationship between low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and myocardial infarction (MI), conducting mediation analysis on a variant associated with both can provide evidence of which pathological pathway the variant is probably involved in. Finally, it should be noted that although previous GWAS following the traditional biomedical strategy have attempted to discover genes conferring risks of age-related diseases, the SNPs associated with them in general are not subject to direct evolutionary selection as these diseases occur during the post-reproductive period so that these SNPs hardly contribute to fitness (Nesse et al., 2012). Therefore, any effect of such SNPs on the diseases is probably mediated through their effects on certain endophenotypes or is modulated by environmental factors (e.g., the grandmother effect; LahdenperÃ¤ et al., 2004). Consequently, effects of relevant variants are often found to be environment-specific and to have different temporal patterns (De Benedictis and Franceschi, 2006; Kulminski, 2013; Yashin et al., 2015). In this case, pleiotropic analysis combined with follow-up mediation analysis and annotation with various expression and regulatory database resources can serve as a substantive tool to elucidate the potential mediator and causality behind the association between SNPs and age-related diseases, which may explain inconsistent genetic effects in different populations even in case of populations of the same ancestry and perfectly harmonized phenotypes (Kulminski, 2013; Yashin et al., 2015).",

          "text": "Over the past decade, GWAS have seen unprecedented success; however, most studies focused on individual phenotypes. While approximately >10,000 genome-wide significant SNPs have been identified to be associated with various phenotypes, studies for identifying genetic pleiotropy of age-related diseases and endophenotypes still lag behind. In recent years, a handful of statistical frameworks based on multivariate or univariate approaches have been proposed (Solovieff et al., 2013). Multivariate models are one of the extensively adopted approaches that have been proposed to deal with multiple phenotypes in a unified framework (O'Reilly et al., 2012; Shriner, 2012). Multivariate approaches take into account phenotypic correlation but often have some limitations in the context of meta-analysis and drawbacks of being incapable of handling phenotypes of different types. For example, it may suffer from reduced statistical power due to removal of subjects with missing values in any phenotype. When searching for the pleiotropy between age-related diseases and endophenotypes, we often face the problem of combining time-to-event outcomes and quantitative or binary traits. In this situation, univariate approaches based on p-values (Fisher, 1925; van der Sluis et al., 2013) or summary statistics (Xu et al., 2003; Zhu et al., 2015) exhibit unique advantages in terms of both statistical power and flexibility. In particular, pleiotropic analysis by systematically combining summary statistics based on existing GWAS results that also takes into account phenotype correlation can be a fast and simple solution to this issue (Zhu et al., 2015).",

We use a slightly modified strategy based on (Zhu et al., 2015) to combine summary statistics from univariate association studies that takes into account the correlation between the statistics for the endophenotypes and diseases. For each newly identified variant that passes a pre-specified significance threshold, we explore its biological implication and regulatory role by performing follow-up functional annotation and examining Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) (The ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012) and Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx) (Lonsdale et al., 2013) databases. This helps detect spurious pleiotropy that may result from linkage disequilibrium (LD) with two causal variants in different genes affecting different endophenotypes or diseases (Solovieff et al., 2013). We further conduct age-dependent time-to-event analyses to investigate temporal patterns of the effects. To distinguish two different types of pleiotropy, we perform a follow-up mediation analysis using a marginal structural model. In particular, to provide more insight into the plausible causal pathways, we focus on studying whether or how much the effect of an identified SNP on an associated disease is mediated through a specific endophenotype.",

Given that Fisher's method does not account for the correlation between the statistics, inflated p-values were expected in the pre-selection stage as most of our phenotypes were weakly to modestly correlated (Figures S1âS6). Therefore, we adopted a two-step strategy to compute more accurate meta-analysis combined p-values for the selected SNPs. More specifically, suppose that for a certain SNP we observe an estimated effect size Î²^ij together with its standard error Ï^ij for the phenotype i (iâ{1, â¦, Kj}) in the study j (jâ{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}), where Kj is the number of phenotypes in the study j. In the first step, following the similar spirit of (Xu et al., 2003; Bolormaa et al., 2014; Zhu et al., 2015), we constructed a general omnibus test statistic z^jâ²Î£j-1z^j that took into account the correlation of effect sizes between the phenotypes, where z^j=Î²^j/Ï^j (Î²^jÂ =(Î²^1j,â¦,Î²^Kjj)â² and Ï^j=(Ï^1j,â¦,Ï^Kjj)â²) and Î£j is the correlation matrix to be estimated. Thus, under the null hypothesis (Î²j = 0) and the assumption of a large sample size, the test statistic approximately follows a chi-square distribution with a degree of freedom (DF) of Kj",

As independent SNPs are recommended for estimating Î£j (Zhu et al., 2015), we simulated 1000 independent SNPs under HWE based on MAF and estimated the correlation matrix Î£j for each study j based on the summary statistics of the simulated SNPs. We checked the multivariate normality assumption for these summary statistics under the null hypothesis using the Henze-Zirkler test (Henze and Zirkler, 1990), and found no evidence of violation of the assumption. The endophenotypes included in the pleiotropic analysis are purported to affect the onset of the complex diseases to some extent. We observed that the majority of the pairwise correlations of the summary statistics from the univariate analysis were lower than 0.3. As combining evidence from highly correlated phenotypes is less informative, within each study, we selected a group of phenotypes (Table â(Table1)1) to ensure that the correlation between any pair of z-scores was less than 0.7 (The correlation matrices of the statistics in the five datasets are depicted in Figures S1âS6). A p-value (e.g., pj) that was smaller than a pre-specified threshold led to the rejection of the null hypothesis, indicating that the SNP was associated with at least one of the phenotypes in the study j (i.e., âi, Î²ij\nâ \n0). Then, we computed a p-value for the meta-analysis using the Fisher's method in which the samples from the six cohorts were treated as independent (we did not observe evident correlation between the summary statistics under the null hypothesis from the two generations in FHS).

LD information for each pair of SNPs was acquired using SNAP (Johnson et al., 2008) and the identified SNPs on each chromosome were aggregated into groups based on pairwise correlation coefficients of LD (i.e., r2). More specifically, a SNP was merged into a group if it was in high LD (r2 > 0.5) with any SNP in the group. We selected the SNP with the most significant p-value within each group as the proxy. To highlight novel SNPs for the downstream analyses, we examined the identified proxy loci in the Ensembl database and employed GRASP (Leslie et al., 2014) to search GWAS catalog data for previously reported associations. Functional consequences of these identified proxy SNPs were annotated using the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (McLaren et al., 2010). To check whether these SNPs had a plausible role in gene expression, we examined whether they were eQTLs or in LD with eQTLs of associated genes. We retrieved information on eQTLs in the gene which the SNP is located in or is flanked by from the GTEx database (Lonsdale et al., 2013) for all available tissues and acquired pairwise LD information using SNAP (Johnson et al., 2008). We examined various regulatory features such as DNase clusters, chromatin interactions, DNA methylation, histone modification from the ENCODE database (The ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012) through the UCSC genome browser. We examined variants in high LD (r2 > 0.8) with the identified SNPs in non-coding regions for their functional annotation and the presence of chromatin histone marks, hypersensitive DNase elements and protein binding sites from the ENCODE and Roadmap databases by using the HaploReg v3 software (Ward and Kellis, 2012).",

We declared the violation if the p-value from the cox.zph function in the survival R package was < 0.05. Any violation of the PH assumption indicated the existence of age-dependent effects, and for such SNPs we acquired an overall picture of its dynamics of the age-dependent effect by utilizing the timecox function in the timereg R package (Martinussen and Scheike, 2007), in which we assumed that the counting process started at the age of 40 as data is modeled by a counting process representation in this method. Other covariates such as sex that did not violate the PH assumption were treated as constants and a cluster-based resampling method was used to correct for the family structure. Based on the produced temporal pattern of the dynamic effects, we further performed stratification analyses to investigate the specific effects in each age group.",

The rationale of the mediation analysis is illustrated in the causal graph (Figure â(Figure2).2). In the longitudinal data, we chose the measurement at the baseline of an endophenotype as a mediator, which ruled out the possibility of reverse causality for most diseases (except cancer) as the measurements occurred well before the onset of diseases. Due to the Mendelian randomization, in general there should be no confounder other than population stratification between the SNPs and the mediators or diseases. We included age and sex as covariates and further assumed that there were no other unmeasured confounders between the assignment of a mediator at the baseline and a disease. We followed a unified approach proposed by Lange et al. (2012) based on marginal structural models (MSMs) (Robins et al., 2000) to estimate the natural direct and indirect effects. We adopted linear regression for the mediator model, and the Cox PH model for the outcome model.

The minor allele of this low-frequency variant was associated with elevated HC, HbA1c levels, increased hazards of stroke and HF, and decreased DBP levels. The PH test suggests that the hazards of CHD were not proportional with respect to the SNP (p = 6.8e-03 from cox.zph). The time-dependent analysis using the timecox function shows that the effect on stroke was age-dependent (Figure â(Figure3B),3B), and the detrimental effect on the hazard of stroke remained almost imperceptible until age 62 but accelerated substantially after the age of ~70. The survival curves from the K-M estimator were consistent (Figure S7). The stratified analysis shows that the HRs before and after age 62 were 1.8408 (p = 0.077) and 3.748 (p = 2.38e-25), respectively. The annotation using the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor shows that rs4905014 is located in a promoter flanking region of a transcript of ITPK1 in multiple cell types (ENSR00001854796). Rs4905014 is within a DNase hypersensitive site in the neuroblastoma cell line (SK-N-SH_RA) and multiple variants in high LD (r2 > 0.8) were found in strong enhancers in multiple cell lines from the ENCODE database (Table S5).

The minor allele of this SNP was associated with elevated BG and TC levels, increased hazards of AF, CHD, stroke, HF and death, and decreased DBP and HDLC levels. The test of the PH assumption suggests that the effect of the SNP on the hazard of stroke was not proportional (p = 2.91e-03 from cox.zph) and the time-dependent analysis shows that the effects on the hazards of CHD and stroke were age-dependent and exhibited different temporal patterns (Figures 3C,D). The survival curves from the K-M estimator were consistent (Figure S7). The effect on CHD remained modest before age 60, increased dramatically between ages 60â70 and leveled off subsequently. The stratified analysis shows that the effect on stroke was much larger and more significant before age 73 than after that (HR = 8.23, p = 3.47e-54 vs. HR = 1.78, p = 0.229). We further noticed that one copy of minor allele had an HR of 7.27 (p = 1.01e-51) while two copies had no significant effect (HR = 2.39, p = 5.82e-02) on stroke.

          "text": "With the recent discovery of a large number of genes and variants influencing endophenotypes and diseases simultaneously (Sivakumaran et al., 2011), pleiotropy has been attracting a lot of interest. A fundamental hypothesis in gerontology is that delaying biological aging process, which is assumed to lead to physical dysfunction and to be implicated in multiple age-related diseases through common underlying mechanisms (i.e., pleiotropic effects), would simultaneously delay the onset and progression of these diseases (Kaeberlein et al., 2015). For example, chronic diseases of aging including CVDs, cancer and ND share pathological links through infection and inflammation (Franceschi, 2007; Larbi et al., 2008; Finch, 2010, 2012). Searching for pleiotropic genetic variants helps validate these substantive hypotheses and pinpoints mechanisms that could be biologically plausible for the most basic processes associated with aging in human. By performing phenome-wide (more than 20 phenotypes or age-related diseases) association analyses followed by pleiotropic meta-analyses with five large-scale longitudinal cohorts, we identified seven novel SNPs that affect multiple endophenotypes and age-related diseases simultaneously. Five out of the seven SNPs are low-frequency variants which might be the reason why they were overlooked in the previous GWAS. It is worth pointing out that almost all these low-frequency variants show detrimental effects, the excess of which may suggest the polygenic inheritance in these diseases (Chan et al., 2014).",

          "text": "Our results suggest that the genome-wide significance of rs7081476 is achieved by aggregating its association with a wide spectrum of diseases across different cohorts. Rs7081476 is located in an intron of ANKRD26, which is involved in hematopoiesis, glucose homeostasis, fat cell differentiation, fatty acid and lipid metabolism, among the other processes (Fei et al., 2011; Raciti et al., 2011; Cesar et al., 2015). Mutations in ANKRD26 or the promoter region have been reported to cause autosomal dominant non-syndromic thrombocytopenia-2 (THC2) (low platelet count) (Noris et al., 2011; Pippucci et al., 2011; Al Daama et al., 2013). Platelets represent an important connection between inflammation and development of CVDs (Willoughby et al., 2002; Wagner and Burger, 2003), which may justify the association with a variety of CVDs in our findings. A mouse model also confirmed that partial inactivation of the ANKRD26 gene caused the development of extreme obesity, insulin resistance and gigantism (Bera et al., 2008), which is in line with our findings of DM and BMI. We further show that the effects of rs7081476 on stroke, HF, CHD, and DM were mediated through several endophenotypes among which BMI had the most significant indirect effect. It has been pointed out that controlling the expression of ANKRD26 would affect megakaryopoiesis and platelet production, perhaps by inducing apoptosis (Pippucci et al., 2011) or MAPK pathway hyperactivation (Bluteau et al., 2014). Interestingly, elevated platelet count may correlate with obesity (Samocha-Bonet et al., 2008). On the other hand, the neighboring MASTL kinase, of which rs7081476 is a direct eQTL, is important for cell cycle regulation and is implicated in normal thrombopoiesis and association with THC2 (Di Paola and Johnson, 2011). This evidence indicates that rs7081476 may be involved in regulatory activity of the genes in THC2 locus functionally related to the hematopoiesis.",

While associated with the CVDs (most significantly with CHD) and mortality, no association was detected with any of the endophenotypes, which may suggest that the effects on the CVDs are irrelevant of the pathway related to the endophenotypes under investigation.

The dynamic effect of rs7632505 on CHD may be explained by the inhibitory effect of SEMA5B on angiogenesis which is related to aging process (LÃ¤hteenvuo and Rosenzweig, 2012) and is purported to be involved in atherosclerosis and other CVDs (Khurana et al., 2005; Deveza et al., 2012). SEMA5B is a member of the phylogenetically conserved class 5 semaphorins that all contain a characteristic Sema domain along with thrombospondin repeats (Adams et al., 1996) and is functionally important for angiogenesis (Iruela-Arispe et al., 1999; Chen et al., 2000; Grundmann et al., 2013). The moderate expression of SEMA5B is detected in multiple tissues including heart and brain (Nagase et al., 2000). Besides, SEMA5B functions as a guidance cue and is implicated in Ca2+-mediated growth cone collapse (To et al., 2007). On the other hand, rs7632505 may associate with the expression of the neighboring PDIA5 gene through LD with the eQTLs and PDIA5 is involved in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) redox homeostasis. In addition, regulatory activity of the PDIA5 gene is required for normal hematopoiesis (Gieger et al., 2011; Bielczyk-MaczyÅska et al., 2014).",

RAB12 (~87 kb) and PTPRM (~116 kb) are the closest protein coding genes. RAB12 is involved in protein transport, degradation of transferrin receptor and autophagy (Matsui and Fukuda, 2013). Maintenance of cellular iron homeostasis is indispensable in the management of diseases and aging, and thus relates to mortality (Altamura and Muckenthaler, 2009; Weinberg, 2010). Inhibition or over-activation of autophagy might be associated with various CVDs (Salabei and Conklin, 2013). PTPRM is required for neurite outgrowth and axonal migration by regulating adhesion through the classical cadherins (Oblander and Brady-Kalnay, 2010). This gene contributes to potassium channels gene regulation in adult cardiac myocytes by cell-cell contact (Hershman and Levitan, 2000). Also, PTPRM may play a role in angiogenesis (Sommer et al., 1997).

          "text": "To sum up, all of the identified pleiotropic SNPs are either within a gene or next to regulatory regions, highlighting the probability of their involvement in gene expression or various regulatory activities. A previous report discovers that disease-associated variants are frequently located in strong enhancer elements and patterns of enhancer activity are strongly correlated with patterns of nearest-gene expression (Ernst et al., 2011). Our results showing that most of the identified variants are associated with tissue-specific strong enhancers, DNase clusters or missense variants are consistent with the previous finding. On the other hand, we further discovered the age-dependent effects of some SNPs on CHD and stroke, confirming the previous findings that the effects of variants on the complex diseases in post-reproductive period could be age-dependent (Kulminski, 2013; Kulminski et al., 2015b; Yashin et al., 2015). It seems that their pleiotropic effects result from their diverse involvement in different underlying mechanisms potentially related to nervous, cardiovascular and immune system functions including axon guidance and angiogenesis (SEMA5B, PTPRM), ion channels (SEMA5B, PTPRM, ITPK1), stress resistance, inflammation and immunity (HSPA8, TMPRSS2/MX1), and hematopoiesis (ANKRD26, HSPA8). On the other hand, some of the SNPs such as rs7081476 and rs8082812 are related to lipids or blood related metabolites. As these metabolites have critical influence on CVDs, DM and thus eventually mortality, the strong association of these SNPs with age-related diseases is mediated, at least in part, through their effects on the metabolites, which can be classified as mediated pleiotropic effects. Interestingly, rs7632505 and rs8082812 with age-dependent effects of minor alleles are linked to genes (SEMA5B, PTPRM) involved in axonal migration and angiogenesis which are age-dependent processes.",

Nevertheless, it may not be the optimal solution to detecting a SNP that affects two correlated phenotypes in the same direction through independent paths. Many extensions to the general omnibus tests have been proposed by assigning different weights for phenotypes (Xu et al., 2003; Zhu et al., 2015).

The definitions and criteria of measurements of the complex diseases and the targeted populations vary in the five cohorts. Moreover, some SNPs are not available in other cohorts as different genotyping chips are adopted in these studies. Imputation did not come to a rescue for harmonizing missing data of low-frequency variants as the imputation quality is low. Because of these, the replication of a significant association in other cohorts is not straightforward. The lack of some replications may also suggest that the effects of age-related loci are more sensitive to environment such as age as many of the identified SNPs have age-dependent effects. In addition, in terms of the statistical power of the omnibus test, the inclusion of many endophenotypes reduces the chance to detect the SNPs that are only associated with a small proportion of phenotypes. Methods with adaptive weights on different phenotypes might identify more signals in this case. Another problem is that although we assumed that there were no other unmeasured confounders than the included covariates underlying the endophenotypes at the baseline and the onset of the complex diseases, it is still possible that these confounders exist, and in this case, the estimated mediation effect would be biased (Pearl, 2000). For example, we observed an indirect effect but no direct effect of rs7081476 on DM that was mediated through HbA1c. However, the no-confounder assumption was probably violated for HbA1c and DM as it has been shown that the association of HbA1c with DM may be explained by its biomarker for the presence and severity of hyperglycemia (Lyons and Basu, 2012).",

          "text": "In conclusion, we identified seven novel loci that exhibit pleiotropic effects on a variety of endophenotypes and age-related diseases using five large-scale longitudinal cohorts. The enrichment of identified pleiotropic variants involved in immune system and inflammation supports the hypothesis of shared pathological role of infection and inflammation in chronic age-related diseases. The findings indicating the potential regulatory involvement of these genetic variants in a diversity of functions contribute to the understanding of the shared mechanisms underlying comorbidity and the relationship between anthropometry, lipid- and blood-related traits, CVDs, DM, and NDs. Our results suggest that the effects on the risk of CVDs often follow different age-dependent patterns and are probably through angiogenesis. These findings are valuable for guiding follow-up analyses and provide evidence for further scrutinizing the molecular mechanisms and implication of the relevant genes in the age-related diseases.",
