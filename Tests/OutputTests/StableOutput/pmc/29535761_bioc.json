It is widely accepted that CL/P results from the complex interplay between multiple genetic and environmental factors (GxE), but only recently have data and practical approaches become available to enable an investigation of these effects at a genome-wide level. Identifying GxE interactions may not only provide important insights into the etiology of orofacial clefts, but may also be important from a public health perspective because of the potential for interventions on environmental risk factors alone, particularly in genetically more susceptible subgroups of the population. This rationale has long been demonstrated in animal models (Millicovsky and Johnston, 1981a,b; Juriloff, 2002), but the evidence in humans is less conclusive. Just as some murine strains are more susceptible to external teratogens, human fetuses harboring high-risk alleles may also be more sensitive to particular environmental risk factors, and identifying those that interact with genetic risk variants may lead to important inroads in our understanding of the causes of CL/P.",

This family-based “triad design” handles bias due to population stratification by using non-transmitted parental alleles as controls, to be compared with the alleles transmitted to the case child (Gjessing and Lie, 2006). We and others have used the triad design to investigate GxE effects in orofacial clefts (Jugessur et al., 2003; Shi et al., 2007; Wu et al., 2010). In terms of statistical power, a unit comprising one case and one control provides approximately the same power as a complete triad when studying single-SNP associations (Schaid, 2002). For haplotype reconstruction, however, the triad design offers the additional advantage of allowing haplotypes to be deduced from the family structure (Gjessing and Lie, 2006).",

Characteristics of the study populations and details of the GWAS have been provided in Beaty et al. (2010). Briefly, genotyping was performed on an Illumina Human610-Quad® platform and genotypes for 589,945 SNPS were deposited in the Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap) under study accession ID phs000094.v1.p1. Besides genotypes, information was also available on maternal cigarette smoking, alcohol intake, and vitamin use in the periconceptional period (i.e., 3 months prior to conception through the first trimester of pregnancy). Interviews and questionnaires were used to assess maternal exposures and the data were coded as simple yes/no responses for cigarette smoking, any reported alcohol consumption, and any use of vitamin supplements. For a detailed description of these maternal exposures, see the recent work on isolated CPO by Wu et al. (2014) and the study outline at dbGAP under study accession ID phs000094.v1.p1. Quality control was performed using the approach outlined in Haaland et al. (2017). The number of SNPs before and after the pruning process is provided in Table ​Table1.1. Figure ​Figure11 shows the distribution of triads by ethnicity and environmental exposure after quality control was performed. Note that we did not analyze GxSmoke or GxAlcohol in the Asian sample because very few of the mothers reported smoking cigarettes or drinking alcohol in the periconceptional period. The final version of the dataset included genotypes for 1,908 nuclear families; 825 were of European ancestry, 1,024 of Asian descent, and 59 of other ethnicities. Table ​Table22 provides an overview of triad completeness and ethnicity. Among the 1,908 nuclear families, 1,594 were complete mother-father-child triads and 314 were parent–child dyads only.",

To identify GxE effects, a Wald test is used to test whether RR estimates for gene-effects in the offspring are significantly different across strata of exposed and unexposed mothers, as described in our previous works (Skare et al., 2012; Gjerdevik et al., 2017). A GxE effect is assessed as the ratio of relative risks (RRR). That is, RRR = RR(1)/RR(0), where RR(1) and RR(0) are the relative risks for the offspring of exposed and unexposed mothers, respectively. If RRR ≠ 1, the RR among the exposed is different from the RR among the unexposed, which would indicate a GxE effect. See Haaland et al. (2017) for more details on the calculation of RRR.",

These SNPs are in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with one another (R2 = 0.77 and D' = 1.00). A third SNP, rs2099557 (q = 0.037), is also located in ESRRG but is in weaker LD with the above two SNPs (R2 = 0.33 and D' = 0.57 with rs1339221; R2 = 0.28 and D' = 0.61 with rs11117745). A regional plot centered around the lead SNP in ESRRG (rs1339221) was generated to visualize the strength of the association signals and regional information around that SNP (Figure ​(Figure8).8). Next, we performed stratified analyses of the SNPs in ESRRG by first testing for an overall child effect in the unstratified sample, followed by the effects among children who were exposed and unexposed to maternal vitamin use, respectively (Table ​(Table6).6). All three SNPs exhibited a so-called “qualitative interaction” (Clayton, 2009), in that the effect of the SNP-allele among mothers taking vitamins was in the opposite direction of that among mothers not taking vitamins. Specifically, RR>1 among non-takers, whereas RR < 1 among takers, and none of the 95% CIs included 1 (Table ​(Table6).6).

First, several studies have reported associations between orofacial clefts and periconceptional maternal cigarette smoking, alcohol intake and vitamin use (reviewed in Jugessur et al., 2009a; Dixon et al., 2011; Marazita, 2012; Rahimov et al., 2012; Leslie and Marazita, 2013; Beaty et al., 2016), but our comprehensive analysis of 334 autosomal cleft candidate genes showed little evidence of interaction with these maternal exposures despite being the largest GxE study of clefts at the time (Skare et al., 2012). Second, the lack of GxE effects may be due to a combination of limited statistical power to detect nothing but the largest GxE effects and the a priori small environmental contributions to CL/P (~9%) and CPO (~10%) (Grosen et al., 2011). Because most previous GxE studies have used a candidate-gene approach and are based on relatively small sample sizes, the small environmental contributions are likely to have further reduced the power to detect a GxE effect. Third, only two genome-wide studies of GxE effects have so far been published in orofacial clefts—in isolated CPO (Beaty et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2014). We thus focused on the larger sample of isolated CL/P and screened for GxE effects using the same GWAS dataset as in Wu et al. (2014).",

          "text": "The connection between vitamins and variants in ESRRG is novel in the context of orofacial clefts. To shed more light on how vitamins, ESRRG and clefting might relate to one another, we performed in silico analyses using the Hetionet database (Figure ​(Figure9).9). By harnessing data from several publicly available meta-databases, Hetionet generates a detailed overview of the relationships between a given disorder/disease, genes and compounds that might easily be overlooked if the focus were solely on specific aspects of disease-gene associations (Greene et al., 2015; Himmelstein et al., 2017). Our analyses revealed a rich network of genes connecting cleft lip to ESRRG and to two vitamins in particular—vitamins A and D. These genes are significantly influenced by the levels of these two vitamins, which might partially explain why the extra vitamin intake by pregnant mothers appears to protect the fetus against clefts. There is some evidence in the literature linking vitamin A itself and genes related to vitamin A, e.g., retinoic acid receptor alpha, RARA, with the risk of orofacial clefts (Rothman et al., 1995; Mitchell et al., 2003; Bille et al., 2007; Johansen et al., 2008; Boyles et al., 2009; Skare et al., 2012). For instance, early studies in mice showed that the timing of exposure to retinoic acid (a metabolite of vitamin A) is important in the disruption of the expression patterns of key growth factors, resulting in abnormally small palatal shelves that cannot fuse (Abbott et al., 1989, 2005; Abbott and Birnbaum, 1990). Compared to vitamin A or vitamin B complex, few studies have examined the effects of high or low dose of vitamin D on clefting risk. Unfortunately, the cleft consortium (Beaty et al., 2010) did not include detailed information on the use of different types of vitamins, which would have allowed a more targeted analysis of vitamins A and D in relation to the ESRRG variants.",

          "text": "The impact of specific variants in ESRRG on the risk of orofacial clefts is also uncharted territory, but several lines of evidence point to a biologically plausible link between estrogens, ESRRG and craniofacial malformations. First, estrogens are a group of steroid-based sex hormones that are involved in several important developmental and physiological processes, including cartilage proliferation and growth, and formation of the craniofacial complex (Ahi, 2016). Second, sex hormones are involved in several traits associated with sexual dimorphism (Callewaert et al., 2010; Randall et al., 2013; Sanger et al., 2014). Given the consistently observed higher male-to-female ratio of isolated CL/P (~2:1 in Caucasians), it is plausible that the skewed sex prevalence is a manifestation of opposing sex steroid actions. Third, exposure to very high or very low doses of estrogens during embryonic development results in craniofacial skeletal malformations in various animal models (Fushimi et al., 2009; Cohen et al., 2014; Morthorst et al., 2016). For instance, when zebrafish are exposed to bisphenol-A (an endocrine-disrupting chemical that mimics estrogen), they develop craniofacial malformations (Kramer et al., 1990). Signaling and dosage regulation of estrogens are finely orchestrated by estrogen receptors (ERs) and estrogen related receptors (ESRRs). These two closely-related families of receptors share target genes, co-regulators and promoters (Maglott et al., 2005). ESRRG, the gene identified in our GxVitamin analyses, encodes the orphan nuclear receptor “Estrogen-related receptor γ” (ERRγ). ERRγ itself does not appear to be important for skeletal development, but it is a sex-dependent negative regulator of postnatal bone formation (Cardelli and Aubin, 2014).",

          "text": "The majority of the genes in Figure ​Figure99 have not previously been linked to orofacial clefts, except perhaps for PDGFA. This gene belongs to the PDGF family of genes that play important roles in the PDGF receptor-alpha (PDGFR-α) signaling pathway. Compared to PDGFA, PDGFC has a well-substantiated role in palatogenesis (Eberhart et al., 2008). Mice with the Pdgfc gene knocked out (Pdgfc−/−) exhibit a complete cleft of the secondary palate (Ding et al., 2004). The phenotype is less severe in Pdgfa−/− mice. The ligands PDGFA and PDGFC share a common pathway with the PDGFR-α receptor in regulating the development of craniofacial structures. Targeted deletion of murine Pdgfra causes neural tube closure defects, including midfacial and palatal clefts (Soriano, 1997). Retinoic acid, on the other hand, inhibits proliferation of embryonic palatal shelves in mice by downregulating Pdgfc activity (Han et al., 2006). Pedigo et al. (2007) later reported the location of a complex retinoic acid response element in a region upstream of the transcription start site of PDGFA that was previously shown to harbor basal and vitamin D-inducible enhancer activity, which lends support to the connections seen between these entities in Figure ​Figure99.",

Using a log-linear model with multiplicative dose-response is a very efficient statistical approach, and case-parent triads provide sufficient information to reconstruct haplotypes with high precision. Yet, our study may still lack power to detect effects that are small. Figure ​Figure1010 depicts power simulations for different sample sizes and different proportions of exposed to unexposed mothers, reflecting those that were available in the current GWAS dataset. The figure shows that there is acceptable power at a nominal significance level of 5% to detect a single-SNP GxE effect with relative risk ratio (RRR) of 1.4 or higher in a sample consisting of 2,000 triads, and an effect with RRR of 1.6 or higher with 1,000 triads. The proportion of exposed to unexposed cases does not have a major impact on power as long as it does not deviate substantially from 1-to-1. In a GWAS setting, there is of course the extra burden of extensive multiple testing. Controlling the FDR in our study for each exposure is less taxing on statistical power and better suited for discovery than, for instance, a strict Bonferroni correction. However, it increases the need for independent verification of top hits.",

Even though it was based on the largest collection of isolated CL/P triads to date, it still had limited statistical power in the smallest group of exposed mothers. This was especially true for the GxSmoke and GxAlcohol analyses in the Asian sample, where the low level of exposure prevented any meaningful GxE analysis. The lack of a replication cohort was also a major shortcoming. Our study is the first to investigate the risk of isolated CL/P using GWAS data in two major ethnicities, and there are currently no other similar studies on isolated CL/P that can be used to confirm our findings. Further, our assumption of a detectable RRR of 1.4 with a sample size of 2,000 triads and an RRR of 1.6 with 1,000 triads may be optimistic in the context of birth defects and complex traits in general. The current scan for GxE effects in isolated CL/P should therefore be considered exploratory and hypothesis-generating at this stage, assuming that other researchers who in the future have access to comparable cleft data and more detailed information on different types of vitamins (including vitamins A and D) would be interested in replicating these findings.",
