Finally, we created 1,000 synthetic pathways matched to an iron metabolism pathway on number of genes, and number of SNPs in each gene.

A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that non-heme iron intake (such as iron derived from vegetables), total iron (iron from heme and non-heme sources) or iron supplements were not associated with increased risk of T2D (Bao et al., 2012). However, epidemiologic studies indicate that increased total body iron stores are associated with an increased risk of T2D (Salonen et al., 1998; Jiang et al., 2004b). While the relation between dietary heme iron intake and obesity has not been well-studied, diets with higher heme iron intake have consistently been associated with increased risk of T2D (Jiang et al., 2004a; Lee et al., 2004; Song et al., 2004; Rajpathak et al., 2006). Iron is a catalyst in the formation of hydroxyl radicals, which are powerful pro-oxidants that attack cellular membrane lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids (Nelson, 1999). While heme iron intake is not directly linked to obesity, excess iron stores produced by dietary behaviors may render pancreatic beta cells particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress because they possess a weak antioxidative stress system (Tiedge et al., 1997).",

Enrichment of SNPs with low p-values was evaluated by comparing Cobs, the count of SNPs with a p-value below a given significance threshold T in the heme metabolic pathway, to Csyn, the corresponding count derived in the synthetic pathways.

Nonetheless we had ~80% power to discover an interaction effect of 1.5 between iron metabolic SNPs and dietary heme iron intake in relation to T2D using similar assumptions in a dominant inheritance model. Second, power could be compromised due to inherent error in measuring dietary heme iron intake. Third, self-reported iron intake, while collected using a validated food frequency questionnaire, could be prone to recall bias. Finally, the reason why a higher dietary heme iron dietary intake increases the risk of T2D could be solely related to environmental influences (Lee et al., 2004).",
